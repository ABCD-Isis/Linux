PHP.INI variables to be checked for ABCD Digital Library :
(Note : 25M is the max. limit of TIKA)

post_max_size = 25M 
upload_max_filesize = 25M   

document repository (structured into subfolders) to be put into htdocs/bases/collection/ABCDImportRepo.
after import the processed documents will be moved, preserving the folder-structure, into /htdocs/bases/collection/

With the 'batch import' tool a fullinverted file generation is obvious (we use the /m parameter to only index the MFN's without the field-related postings), while with the interactive document import feature in principle an 'incremental' indexing with 'ifupd=' should be used. For some reason this is not yet behaving well whereas in command-line environment it works without a hitch.
