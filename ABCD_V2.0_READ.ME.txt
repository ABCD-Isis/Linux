README for ABCD v2.0 Beta


1. This is a beta-version for testing, so not everything might still be working.
2. Always when installing a new version of ABCD, make sure you have a backup of your databases (as ISO-files) and make sure you know how to move them back into the new version  : if the same databases are there : by importing the ISO, if not : by copying the base-folder and its dbn.par and DBN.def into the existing new installation.
3. HIGHLIGHTS of version 2.0 (and the reason why we consider this a MAJOR upgrade) :

3.0 The use of different CISIS-versions in addition to the standard ('1660') version : BigISIS for Linux and FFI for Windows, allowing much bigger records up to 1Mb each.
3.1 Added feature : Digital Library with full-text search and both batch and interactive loading of documents (PDF, Word etc.)
3.2 Added module : ODDS (Online Document Delivery Service)
3.3 Added module : OAI for Open Archives Initiative harvesting
3.4 Added function in Central : Thesaurus consultation (with agrovoc sample)
3.5 Added utilities :
	- full-inverted file generation with MX (much faster)
	- ISO import and export with MX (much faster)
	- compacting database as combined export-import with MX

	- batch import of documents into dublin-core repository database
