<p>Installation of ABCD in WAMP
</p>
<p>Introduction
This guide will illustrate and give instructions on how to install the ABCD software
based on a WAMP installation. It is perfectly possible to integrate both types of
applications and run both &lsquo;normal&rsquo; Apache/PHP-based applications (e.g.
phpMyAdmin, Drupal,&hellip;) and ABCD at the same time with the same basic
configuration.
The only skill required really is to locate and edit text-files with a text-editor like
Notepad.
ABCD is the ISIS-based integrated library automation software which also allows
automating documentation centres and other types of collections, due to its built-
in flexibility and powerful functions. A standard installation of ABCD (mostly done
by simply unpacking the installation package file) contains not only the ABCD-
scripts and databases (in the www-folder) but also a folder for Apache and a
folder for PHP. After configuring ABCD correctly as instructed here with WAMP,
both the PHP and Apache folder in principle can be removed from the ABCD-
installation.
</p>
<p>WAMP stands for &lsquo;Windows Apache MySQL and PHP), a very popular package of
often combined softwares to run web-based applications. Apache is the web-
server, MySQL the database in which values from which dynamic websites can be
created are stored and PHP is the scripting language to create the web-pages.
Normally WAMP comes with its own full installer executable (or .msi file) which
indeed installs the Apache webserver, MySQL (server and client) and PHP. On top
of that WAMP offers &ndash; and this is a major added-value &ndash; a &lsquo;WAMP-manager&rsquo; icon in
the taskbar from where not only all the services can be (re-)started or stopped,
but also the main settings for all three services can be accessed and managed.
E.g. php.ini (PHP settings) and httpd.conf (Apache webserver configuration) and
my.ini (settings for MySQL) are directly accessible, also version information for all
three servers is available and direct access is given to phpMyAdmin.</p>

<p/>
<p>Configuring Apache webserver with virtual hosts
The main solution we propose is to configure Apache webserver, as part of
WAMP, with virtual hosts settings.
This requires two steps, supposing the installed Apache version is 2.2.17
(change when appropriate to your actual version !) :
1. Including the virtual-hosts settings file and moving the virtual host settings
</p>
<p>from the basic settings :
a. open (with any text-editor, e.g. Notepad) the file
</p>
<p>\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.2.17\conf\httpd.conf
b. remove (or de-activate by putting the &lsquo;#&rsquo; comment sign in front)
</p>
<p>the following statements, since we don&rsquo;t want to keep them in the
basic configuration for all applications :
</p>
<p>i. Listen 80
ii. DocumentRoot "c:/wamp/www/"
iii. ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "cgi-bin/"
</p>
<p>c. remove the &lsquo;#&rsquo; before the &lsquo;include&rsquo; statement in the following
section towards the end, in order to activate the statement and
make the virtual hosts configuration active :
</p>
<p># Virtual hosts
Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
</p>
<p>d. Save the file httpd.conf
</p>
<p>2. Edit the virtual hosts settings in the file extra\httpd-vhosts.conf (with any
text-editor) in order to make it contain the following two sections, one for
the default host with port 80, one for the ABCD-dedicated port 9090 :
</p>
<p>a. Create the two virtual hosts with their resp. &lsquo;listening port&rsquo; :
NameVirtualHost *:80
Listen 80
NameVirtualHost *:9090
Listen 9090
</p>
<p>b. Define the settings for default virtual host by adding the following
lines :
</p>
<p>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
ServerRoot "c:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.2.17"
DocumentRoot "/wamp/www/"
&lt;Directory "c:/wamp/www/"&gt;
</p>
<p>Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
AllowOverride all
</p>
<p>Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from 127.0.0.1
</p>
<p>&lt;/Directory&gt;
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "cgi-bin/"
</p>
<p>&lt;Directory "cgi-bin"&gt;
AllowOverride None</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>Options None
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</p>
<p>&lt;/Directory&gt;
PHPIniDir "c:/wamp/bin/php/php5.3.4"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</p>
<p>c. Create a section for the ABCD-port 9090 virtual host, by adding the
following lines :
</p>
<p>&lt;VirtualHost *:9090&gt;
ServerRoot "c:/abcd/apache2.2"
DocumentRoot "/ABCD/www/htdocs"
&lt;Directory "c:/ABCD/www/htdocs/"&gt;
</p>
<p>Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
AllowOverride all
</p>
<p>Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from 127.0.0.1
</p>
<p>&lt;/Directory&gt;
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin "/ABCD/www/cgi-bin/"
&lt;Directory "/ABCD/www/cgi-bin/"&gt;
</p>
<p>AllowOverride None
Options None
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</p>
<p>&lt;/Directory&gt;
#PHPIniDir "/ABCD/php"
# next 2 lines are only for ABCD EmpWeb
ProxyPass /empweb/ http://localhost:8080/empweb/
ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</p>
<p>d. Save the httpd-vhost.conf file and re-start your Apache service (the
easiest way is to use the WAMP-manager icon and go to the Apache
&lsquo;restart service&rsquo; option).
</p>
<p>Configuring PHP
e. It is &ndash; most unfortunately &ndash; not possible to refer to 2 different PHP-
</p>
<p>settings by including the directive &lsquo;PHPIniDir&rsquo; twice (or more) in the
virtual hosts settings. Apache will only observe the first one and
report the second one as an error. So one can either leave that
directive into the basic configuration file httdp.conf or put it into one
(and only one) of the virtual hosts sections of the httpd-vhosts.conf
file :
</p>
<p>PHPIniDir "c:/wamp/bin/php/php5.3.4"
One could put such statement e.g. before closing the virtual-host
section (&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;).
</p>
<p>f. Add the php-extensions which ABCD needs but are possibly not yet
active in WAMP, by removing the leading &lsquo;;&rsquo; or adding if not yet</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>present in the section of the file &lsquo;php.ini&rsquo; (in WAMP with PHP5.3.4
you will find this in C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.4) labeled as &lsquo;Dynamic
Extensions&rsquo; :
</p>
<p>;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Dynamic Extensions ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
extension=php_gd2.dll
extension=php_pdo.dll
extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll
extension=php_xsl.dll
extension=php_yaz.dll
</p>
<p>g. Other php.ini settings could be slightly different in between WAMP
and ABCD, but after some testing we didn&rsquo;t find them to be really
important for either ABCD or WAMP, but rather &lsquo;fine-tuning&rsquo; settings.
</p>
<p>h. Copy the here added extension DLL&rsquo;s from your ABCD-php extension
directory (folder) to the one of WAMP, probably being resp.
\ABCD\php\ext and \WAMP\bin\php\php5.3.4\ext.
Beware : don&rsquo;t copy existing ABCD-extensions over existing WAMP-
extensions, only add non-existing ones !
Warning : if the PHP version is indeed different, you will need to
download the correct versions for the WAMP-PHP configuration. If e.g.
your ABCD PHP is using version 5.2 but WAMP is using 5.3, you will
have to load the correct versions for version 5.3, as that is the one
we will be using.
Since WAMP installs its own MySQL server (in the folder
\WAMP\bin\mysql) with its data-folder inthere as a subfolder, you
might &ndash; but only if you use MySQL for the ABCD EmpWeb Advanced
Loans module &ndash; have to reconfigure your MySQL configuration, i.e.
the following directives might need to be edited in order to refer to
the MySQL-folder used when installing MySQL for EmpWeb :
</p>
<p>basedir=c:/wamp/bin/mysql/mysql5.1.53
log-error=c:/wamp/logs/mysql.log
datadir=c:/wamp/bin/mysql/mysql5.1.53/data
</p>
<p>This file &lsquo;my.ini&rsquo; also allows to set the port (default =3309) and
password/login to access your MySQL.
</p>
<p>3. Restart all services to test the new set-up. If you have done all previous
steps correctly, it should be possible to open both default port web-
applications, e.g.
</p>
<p>http://localhost/phpMyAdmin
and ABCD-port9090 applications :
</p>
<p>http://localhost:9090/</p>
