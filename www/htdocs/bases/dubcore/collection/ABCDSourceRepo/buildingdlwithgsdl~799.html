<p>1. Introduction 
</p>
<p> 
A digital library is an organized collection of digital documents, in any format 
</p>
<p>such as text, image, audio or video, that would permit easy access by information 
</p>
<p>users and proper maintenance by librarians. Digital libraries do not replace the 
</p>
<p>physical libraries built with brick and mortar. But they do replace the concept of 
</p>
<p>a library as a repository of knowledge with the notion of it as a provider of 
</p>
<p>information services to users. In this age of exponential growth of information 
</p>
<p>materials in print as well as digital form, both physical and digital libraries are 
</p>
<p>essential and can work in unison, supplementing each other. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Greenstone Digital Library Software (GSDL) is a fantastic and functionally rich 
</p>
<p>application that offers exciting ways to build and distribute digital document 
</p>
<p>collections.  It helps us to publish digital collections on the Internet or on CD-
</p>
<p>ROM. The GSDL enables librarians /information managers to build and organize 
</p>
<p>digital document collections into highly useful digital libraries. Within a few 
</p>
<p>minutes time, one can build full-text search indexes and browsing classifiers for any 
</p>
<p>collection of digital documents. Once initiated, the collection building process 
</p>
<p>will take place mechanically, running into several hours or days for a very large 
</p>
<p>collection.

<p>Downloading digital documents from World Wide Web, organizing them into 
</p>
<p>focused collections and making the materials accessible to others can be a prime 
</p>
<p>application area of digital libraries.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1.1 Objective of this Guide 
</p>
<p>The objective of this write up is to narrate, with screenshots, the most essential 
</p>
<p>basic steps in building up a digital library of collection containing a few 
</p>
<p>documents in a simple and easy-to-learn style, in windows operating system. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1.2 Software Installation 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Software Download Sites 
</p>
<p>The GSDL 2.72 software can be downloaded from http://www.greenstone.org or 
</p>
<p>http://greenstonesupport.iimk.ac.in/our_mission.htm. 
</p>
<p>Java2 Runtime Environment can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com 
</p>
<p>ImageMagic can be had from http://www.imagemagic.org 
</p>
<p>Ghostscipt can be obtained from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Installation of Software 
</p>
<p> 
Install Java2 Runtime Environment in your computer as a pre-requisite for 
</p>
<p>installing GSDL software. Then install the GSDL 2.72 (windows version) 
</p>
<p>software in your computer. Choose the Local Library mode for installation. You 
</p>
<p>may install Image Magic and Ghostscript softwares, required to build image 
</p>
<p>collection and to do advanced conversion of PDF and Postscript documents, 
</p>
<p>respectively. Export to CD-ROM functionality also needs to be installed (if that 
</p>
<p>functionality is not included in the GSDL 2.72) for converting your digital library 
</p>
<p>into a CD-ROM library. While installing the softwares, just choose the default 
</p>
<p>options in the installation wizard.

<p>2. Building up a Collection with GLI 
</p>
<p> 
The simplest way to build a new digital library collection is to use Greenstone's 
</p>
<p>Librarian Interface1 (GLI), a component of Greenstone Digital Library software. 
</p>
<p>GLI allows one to collect the documents, import or assign metadata, and build 
</p>
<p>the documents into a digital library, and convert it into a CD-ROM library. 
 
</p>
<p>GLI can be used to perform the following basic activities, while building up a 
</p>
<p>collection: - 
</p>
<p>1. Gather documents for building up the collection 
2. Enrich the documents by adding metadata 
3. Design the collection, its appearance and the access facilities   
4. Format the appearance of the digital library  
5. Create the collection 
6. Convert the digital library into a CD-ROM library 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Start a New Collection 
</p>
<p> 
Open the GLI from the Start &rArr; Programs &rArr; Greenstone Digital Library 
Software v2.72 &rArr; Greenstone Librarian Interface. 
 
</p>
<p>To start a new collection, choose New from the File menu.

<p>                                                 
1 GLI is a Dos based program created for making the collection building process easier for librarians who 
do not have much knowledge to configure a collection. It works in four modes - Library Assistant, 
Librarian, Library System Specialist and Expert. Librarian is the suitable choice for beginner's and is the 
default mode. When you go up to the level of Expert, you will get more options to build. You can go to file 
&rArr; preference to change the mode.

<p>Fill up a name for the collection  (against Collection title) and a brief description

<p>2.1 Gather the Documents 
</p>
<p> 
Now the Gather panel will become active and it allows the user to collect the 
</p>
<p>required documents by exploring the entire computer. Then select the files or 
</p>
<p>directories by browsing the folders in the computer. Drag and drop th
</p>
<p>right hand pane by your mouse. You can drag the documents either individually 
</p>
<p>or as sets of documents in folders/subfolders.

<p>2.2 Enriching Documents with Metadata 
</p>
<p>The next stage is to enrich the documents by adding metadata3. You can Select 
</p>
<p>the individual document and add metadata such as title, creators or subjects 
</p>
<p>manually. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Click on Enrich tab and it will bring up a panel. Left side of the panel under 
</p>
<p>Collection tab shows the files. The right side, on clicking, will allow adding 
</p>
<p>metadata for each document on each metadata field in the Value box against the 
</p>
<p>Element. Here we use Dublin Core metadata and that is why dc. is prefixed with 
</p>
<p>name of metadata elements such as Title, Publisher etc.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>pre-fixed with dc. (eg. dc.Title) denotes dublin core metadata, ex. (eg. ex.Title) denotes extracted metadata, 
exp. (eg. exp.Title) denotes exploded metadata. Here we use Dublin Core metadata by giving value against 
the metadata element after s

4 Plug-ins, written in perl language, will translate the source document into a common form, parse them and 
extract metadata from them. For example, the html plug-in converts the Web pages to greenstone archive 
format and extract metadata that is explicit in the original document from the html source tags.

tton name against it, while configuring the browsing classifiers. It is better to use the default button name 
itially, so as to avoid the complexities.

10 During the building process, the text of the documents will be compressed and the indexes specified will 
be generated in order to ensure the availability of the collection for search and retrieval. GNU Data Base 
Manager, a program used within the Greenstone software, will store the metadata of each document. 
Managing Gigabytes is the program used by the Greenstone system for fulfilling indexing that incorporates 
compression techniques.

<p>3.  Conclusion 
</p>
<p>The basic greenstone collection with normal look and feel can be created within a 
</p>
<p>few minutes time, once you know how to use the components of the software 
</p>
<p>dynamically. The digital library collection created as above can be customized 
</p>
<p>later in a variety of ways. The customization of the collection can be done, 
</p>
<p>whenever you like, by opening the collection, which can be done by clicking on 
</p>
<p>the menu, File &rArr; Open and selecting the appropriate collection in the GLI . 
 
</p>
<p>Format Features allows unlimited choices in modifying the appearance of the 
</p>
<p>collection. The users, having close familiarity with Greenstone, can radically alter 
</p>
<p>the style of the pages generated, by changing the macro files, the total number of 
</p>
<p>which is around 20, included in the &lsquo;macro&rsquo; folder of the Greenstone installation. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Greenstone\tmp\exported_Demo) into a blank 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>A general-purpose digital library like greenstone is an excellent tool to provide 
</p>
<p>information services in our libraries. Absence of knowledge on how to use it, 
</p>
<p>should not come in the way of exploiting the advantages it offers. This 
</p>
<p>documentation may be used as a tool to bring in more people to the growing 
</p>
<p>constituency of greenstone users. We, the librarians, can improve our 
</p>
<p>capabilities, as knowledge managers, if we are particular in learning the 
</p>
<p>information technology tools like greenstone and use them for managing 
</p>
<p>knowledge resources. We should learn, utilise, promote and propagate 
</p>
<p>greenstone to make our libraries better.
