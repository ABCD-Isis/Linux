<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>I. Introduction : background and concepts of EmpWeb
</p>
<p> I.1 Name and history
EmpWeb or 'Emprestamos en Web' (Portuguese for 'loans in WWW') is an advanced Circulation 
module, which has been integrated into ABCD since 2010. It pre-existed as a DOS-application 
(Emp) and has been tested/used thoroughly in some Latin-American libraries, then transformed into
a WWW-based software. As such it was acquired, from the Uruguyan company 'KALIO' which 
programmed both the DOS and WWW-versions, by the ABCD-team (with the support of 
VLIR/UOS, the Flemish (Belgian) Interuniversity Council) and fully incorporated into ABCD as a 
module, which could serve as an alternative to the built-in ABCD circulation sub-module in the 
Central module. 
</p>
<p> I.2 EmpWeb as an ABCD module
The following overview of ABCD as a 'suite' of modules can illustrate this : 
</p>
<p>p. 3</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>As can be seen in this scheme, EmpWeb is a 'module' of the suite at the same level of Central, Secs-
Web, iAH and the Site. However, since EmpWeb does not use PHP (but Java) it will not be installed
in the ABCD/www-directory, where the other modules and the ISIS-executables are found, but in its
own sub-directory in the ABCD-folder.
</p>
<p>The integration with some functions of ABCD Central, e.g. the 'ABCD MySite', is assured by the 
fact that EmpWeb uses the catalog(s) maintained in ABCD-Central and the specific structure of the 
ABCD-Loanobjects database, with all copies of a title as repeated occurrences of v959. On top of 
that a connection is provided by the 'bridge' folder in the Central module, where an 'end-point' web-
service to a MySQL-database is available using NuSoap-PHP scripts and definitions of the queries 
(in config.inc.php). In this way EmpWeb can access an external MySQL users database, also storing
its own transactions, rules and policies in its own SQL-tables while still accessing ISIS-catalogs. 
This way we think the best of both worlds (SQL and no-SQL) are combined !
</p>
<p> I.3 EmpWeb vs. ABCD Central Circulation 
In the 'ABC of ABCD' manual, which serves as mainly an ABCD Central guide, an explanation is 
given on the differences in between EmpWeb as the 'advanced loans module' and the built-in 
Central submodule for Circulation. While this submodule since version 1.4 also includes 
reservations and MySite-functions, it is functionally equivalent to EmpWeb, using only ISIS-
technology, but still with some more advanced (and often unnecessary) features of EmpWeb 
missing : 
</p>
<p>&bull; the principally more efficient handling of simple transaction records in SQL
</p>
<p>&bull; possibility to link to SQL-stores for users on different servers and merging them with ISIS-
user records
</p>
<p>&bull; the possibility to define easily several (even many) policies, e.g. a 'summer-' and 'exam-
period'-policy, and switch in between them
</p>
<p>&bull; to manage the circulation system for several libraries/branches with separate or merged 
statistics.
</p>
<p>In this way EmpWeb is still the 'advanced' circulation module of ABCD and the decision to use it or
not (then rather the ABCD Central circulation module) should be based on the criteria above. We  
can imagine that many esp. bigger organisations with more complex structure, such as university 
libraries, will benefit from these features while also having the necessary SQL-expertise on board. 
Smaller libraries however can perfectly run their circulation system based on ABCD-Central.
</p>
<p>For further reading we refer to our paper published in Program [ref].
</p>
<p> I.4 EmpWeb architecture and technical aspects
EmpWeb is actually a rather 'generic decision-making engine' which acts as a tool to make 
</p>
<p>p. 4</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>decisions (yes/no) based on rules implemented into the system, in our case as rules to yes or not 
allow and perform a transaction of a library loans-system : issuing/returning/renewing/reserving a 
book and dealing with fines and suspensions. The 'architecture' of EmpWeb is illustrated below :
</p>
<p>The 'ISIS driver' is actually the CISIS-utility 'mx' which is called upon with specific commands 
selecting catalog-records and joining in them information from the loanobjects-database. As already
mentioned, also ISIS-userdatabases can be accessed using the same method. EmpWeb's proper 
databases (or tables in fact) with transactions and rules/policies are accessed by one of the JDBC-
drivers available, meaning most SQL-databases (MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL, PostGres...) are in the 
picture. The 'GUI' is styled along the ABCD-system's Cascading Style Sheets, with additional 'plug-
ins' into the ABCD iAH (OPAC) to allow checking the availability of copies of a title and if needed 
reserving them through the 'MySite' function of ABCD. The use of this GUI as an ABCD-module 
will be discussed later in this manual but is intended to be quite easy and efficient of course. Other 
interfaces to the engine, as indicated into the picture above, are possible but remain outside the 
scope of this manual.
</p>
<p>p. 5</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>Technically EmpWeb is a Java servlets-based application, running on a Java-servlet server like Jetty
or TomCat, and using a typical SQL-database through one of the JDB-connectors. But it can also 
access, through web-services, ISIS-databases. In fact EmpWeb will use the ISIS-catalogues and, 
optionally, the ISIS-users databases along with the SQL-tables for users (through web-services) and 
the transactions themselves. Also the rules and policies are all stored into SQL-tables.  
</p>
<p>Ideally therefore quite some SQL-related skills are present in the organisation when using EmpWeb.
E.g. to make back-ups one has to know where the SQL-tables are stored, how to compact SQL-
databases, how to export them to statistics-analysis software etc. Interfaces such as the web-based 
PHPMyAdmin tool can make this type of management much easier if the system-manager is not 
comfortable with the available command-line approach of the database.
</p>
<p>As a conclusion we repeat that EmpWeb combines the best of both the SQL- and no-SQL worlds in 
one powerful flexible decision-making engine.
</p>
<p> I.5 EmpWeb pipe-lines
The decisions to be taken by the EmpWeb 'engine' are put in 'pipe-lines' (or sequences) of individual
decisions, while at every decision the pipe-line can be exited if there is a negative decision and only
at the end of the sequence or pipe-line, if all decisions were positive, the transaction will be granted 
and executed. E.g. when deciding on whether or not to allow a book to be issued to a user 'X', the 
following decisions, amongst some others, are to be considered : 
</p>
<p>&bull; whether the user X is known to the system and if so to which user-class s/he belongs
</p>
<p>&bull; whether his/her status is 'active' (e.g. not suspended, not having fines to pay if it is defined 
as a requirement to be clear of any fines in order to loan from the library)
</p>
<p>&bull; whether or not the user has already reached the overall maximum allowed number of objects
on loan 
</p>
<p>&bull; whether the object (book) is known to the system and belongs to the library involved
</p>
<p>&bull; whether the object has copies available for loaning, and more than the defined minimum to 
remain in the library itself
</p>
<p>&bull; whether or not the available copies have not (yet) been reserved by another user
</p>
<p>&bull; whether or not the loans-policy (number of books, how many days etc.) have been defined 
for this specific combination of a user-category with an object-category
</p>
<p>&bull; whether or not the maximum number of loans for this specific object-category for this user 
has been reached
</p>
<p>&bull; etc...
</p>
<p>p. 6</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>If an EmpWeb-using library is of the opinion that it might be more efficient to first check on the 
status of the object and only if all is o.k to proceed with the user-'context' (as it is called in 
EmpWeb), then the system manager can re-arrange the sequence by shifting up the object-related 
decisions in the pipe-line. The EmpWeb GUI makes this a very easy exercise.
</p>
<p>An graphical representation of such a pipe-line is given in the following illustration.
</p>
<p>So, EmpWeb allows the system-manager to re-arrange and re-define all such sequences of decisions
in the pipe-lines, thereby giving an extremely high flexibility in the system-management. System-
managers who know how to use the Groovy-scripting in Java can also re-define the contents (not 
only the sequence) of the rules and decisions.
</p>
<p>Here is a sample rule in Groovy code, to show it is rather 'readable'. The code actually will after 
getting the location (biblioteca or 'library') of the copy and of the operator, compare them and if 
different issue an error message to alert that the book does not belong to the actual library :
</p>
<p>copyId=&nbsp;tc.get(TransactionContext.COPY_ID);&nbsp;
</p>
<p>biblioteca=&nbsp;tc.getObjectValue("//hold:copy[hold:copyId='$
{copyId}']/hold:copyLocation");&nbsp;transExtras=&nbsp;
tc.get(TransactionContext.TRANSACTION_EXTRAS);&nbsp;
</p>
<p>operatorLocation=&nbsp;transExtras&nbsp;!=&nbsp;null&nbsp;?&nbsp;
transExtras.get("operatorLocation")&nbsp;:&nbsp;"";&nbsp;
</p>
<p>if&nbsp;(operatorLocation&nbsp;!=&nbsp;biblioteca)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;msg.setText("This&nbsp;object&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;belong&nbsp;to&nbsp;this&nbsp;library&nbsp;but&nbsp;
to&nbsp;:"+biblioteca);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;false;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</p>
<p>else&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;true;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>p. 7</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>However some basic pipeline 'classes' are pre-compiled into the EmpWeb system and cannot easily 
(without fully recompiling the whole software) be changed, e.g.
</p>
<p>&bull; GetUser&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&bull; ExtractUserClass&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&bull; GetObject&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&bull; ExtractObjectCategory
</p>
<p>&bull; GetObject&nbsp;Status
</p>
<p>As an example of such non-alterable but robust fixed classes we list here the 'GetObjectStatus' 
code :
</p>
<p>public&nbsp;class&nbsp;GetObjectStatus&nbsp;implements&nbsp;Process
</p>
<p>{
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;ProcessResult&nbsp;execute(TransactionContext&nbsp;tc)&nbsp;throws&nbsp;
EngineException,&nbsp;Exception
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;String&nbsp;objectDb=&nbsp;(String)tc.get(TransactionContext.OBJECT_DB);
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String&nbsp;recordId=&nbsp;(String)tc.get(TransactionContext.RECORD_ID);
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EmpwebDB&nbsp;ewdb=&nbsp;WSBroker.getEwdb();
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ObjectStatus&nbsp;oStat=&nbsp;ewdb.getRecordStatus(recordId,&nbsp;objectDb);
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tc.put(TransactionContext.OBJECT_STATUS,&nbsp;oStat);
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;Nothing&nbsp;special&nbsp;to&nbsp;return,&nbsp;should&nbsp;always&nbsp;get&nbsp;OserStatus&nbsp;object,&nbsp;or&nbsp;
an&nbsp;EngineException.&nbsp;BBB&nbsp;right?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;new&nbsp;ProcessResult(true);
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;//&nbsp;execute
</p>
<p>}&nbsp;//&nbsp;GetObjectStatus
</p>
<p>An&nbsp;example&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Groovy&nbsp;editable&nbsp;rule&nbsp;to&nbsp;check&nbsp;the&nbsp;validity&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;user&nbsp;:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&lt;rule&nbsp;class="net.kalio.empweb.engine.rules.GetUser"&nbsp;name="GetUser"&gt;

</p>
<p> I.6 EmpWeb policies
</p>
<p>For any combination of user- with object-categories a 'profile' can be created with values for the 
circulation-parameters (called 'limits' in EmpWeb); a set of a number of such profiles is a 'policy' 
and any number of policies can be created, e.g. one for each specific period/season in a university 
library. By doing so, a 'third dimension' (time) is added to the two-dimensional space of user/object 
tuples.
</p>
<p>A policy has to take into account several 'contexts' &ndash; technically treated as 'objects' in the scripts : 
</p>
<p>Complex policies : 
</p>
<p>The Engineering library (ING acronym) is included in the summer policy that we designed 
previously, but for the user class &ldquo;Co-ordinators&rdquo;, it will loan BKS for 20 days. Please, control the 
validity of the users previous to make any operation because if the expiration date is blank, 
Empweb is not doing actually any control! 
</p>
<p>The Agronomics library (AGR) does not admit to make on-line reservations for users which validity
expire in 6 months or less. All the libraries in the system agree that if a confirmed reservation is 
cancelled or expired a suspension and/or a fee should be applied. If there are &lt; 2 reservations for the
same title will apply a fee of $10, if there are &gt;=2 reservations, will apply the fee and a suspension 
of 5 days.
</p>
<p>When translated into script-rules : 
</p>
<p>p. 9</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>If&nbsp;object.library&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lsquo;ING&rsquo;&nbsp;and&nbsp;user.type=&lsquo;Cordinadores&rsquo;&nbsp;then&nbsp;loan.days=20&nbsp;
@loan&nbsp;pipeline.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If&nbsp;user.validity&nbsp;==&ldquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;or&nbsp;user.validity&nbsp;is&nbsp;null&nbsp;then&nbsp;transaction.stop &nbsp;@&nbsp;
loan,reservation&nbsp;pipelines&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If&nbsp;month_difference_between&nbsp;(today,user.validity)&lt;=6&nbsp;and&nbsp;
transaction.comesfrom==&lsquo;web&rsquo;&nbsp;then&nbsp;transaction.stop.&nbsp; @reservation&nbsp;pipeline
</p>
<p>Create_new_fee();&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If&nbsp;reservations.count()&gt;2&nbsp;then&nbsp;Create_suspension()&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;@cancelreservation&nbsp;
pipeline&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Then still more complexity can be added, e.g. 
</p>
<p>All the libraries in the system agree that if a confirmed reservation is cancelled or expired, if there 
are &lt; 2 reservations for the same title a fee of $10 will apply, if there are &gt;=2 reservations, a fee and
a suspension of 5 days will apply.
</p>
<p>At any time the libraries can agree to 'review' this rule, e.g. : 
</p>
<p>All the libraries in the system agree that if a confirmed reservation is canceled or expired, a 
suspension and/or a fee should be applied. If there are &lt; 3 reservations for the same title will apply 
a fee of X, if there are &gt;=3 reservations, will apply the fee and a suspension of Y days. 
</p>
<p>In a scheme then the parameters can be shown as follows :

</p>
<p>II. Installation of EmpWeb
</p>
<p>This manual supposes that Java JDK (not JRE) and a SQL-database (e.g. MySQL) have been 
installed already, using their own manuals and configuration setting tools. So we refer to the amply 
existing help documents on installing these and will focus only on the EmpWeb requirements 
proper.
</p>
<p> II.1 The EmpWeb launcher
In order to not only launch EmpWeb but also give it its main configuration parameters, in both 
Windows and Linux a script is used : empweb.sh (Linux) or empweb.bat (Windows). There is no 
need to understand this script, with its many typical scripting 'tricks', in detail but some useful 
information about this script is given here.
</p>
<p>The script has to be invoked not only by its name but with  one mandatory parameter : 'start', 'stop' 
being the most relevant ones. Without such parameter an error will be shown.
</p>
<p>In fact this script will start the EmpWeb system as a Java-application, with a command to run Java 
followed by (quite some) parameters.
</p>
<p>The actual 'run-command' , invoked towards the end of the script, is defined as : 
</p>
<p>RUN_CMD="$JAVA&nbsp;$JAVA_OPTIONS&nbsp;&nbsp;&shy;jar&nbsp;$JETTY_HOME/"start.jar"&nbsp;$CONFIGS"
</p>
<p>so all components of the command are constructed into variables (names starting with '$') which are
defined earlier on in the script.
</p>
<p>The '$JAVA' variable points to the actual java-executable in your system. The $JAVA_OPTIONS 
are defined again based on elsewhere defined variables : 
</p>
<p>JAVA_OPTIONS="&shy;server&nbsp;&shy;DSTART=$JETTY_START&nbsp;&nbsp;&shy;Djetty.home=$JETTY_HOME&nbsp;
&shy;Dempweb.home=$EMPWEB_HOME&nbsp;&shy;Djava.util.logging.config.file=$LOGGING_CONF&nbsp;
&shy;Daxis.xml.reuseParsers=true&nbsp;&shy;Dsun.net.client.defaultConnectTimeout=10000&nbsp;
&shy;Dcisis.location=$CISIS_LOCATION&nbsp;&shy;Dcisis.command=$CISIS_COMMAND&nbsp;
&shy;Dabcd.url=$ABCD_URL&nbsp;&shy;Dcisis.platform=$OS&nbsp;&shy;Xms128M&nbsp;&shy;Xmx128M&nbsp;&shy;Xincgc"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The relevant parts &ndash; for system management &ndash; of the script are discussed below.
</p>
<p> II.1.1 Embedding into the ABCD-system
First of all the EmpWeb script puts the module into the ABCD-context with some easy-to-
understand variables : where is it and how to call ABCD-Central.
</p>
<p>p. 11</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>EMPWEB_HOME="/opt/ABCD/empweb"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>ABCD_URL="http://localhost:9090/"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>OS="linux"&nbsp;
</p>
<p> II.1.2 The Jetty-server configuration
ABCD comes with EmpWeb pre-configured along with its own servlets-server 'Jetty'.
</p>
<p>Jetty is a FOSS (free) server software very much comparable to the better known Tomcat. In fact 
both can do the same and are interchangeable, meaning EmpWeb can also be configured to work 
with Tomcat in existing installations (e.g. of dSpace or Web-JISIS applications).
</p>
<p>The Jetty server files are just in a subfolder of EmpWeb, which itself is a subfolder in the main 
ABCD-folder (see infra).
</p>
<p>In fact nothing has to be changed into the Jetty-server configuration as it comes with the ABCD-
installation files.
</p>
<p>The Jetty-server will be correctly linked into ABCD by the start-up script of EmpWeb (empweb.sh 
for Linux and empweb.bat for Windows). These are the relevant lines (for the Windows-version) :
</p>
<p>REM&nbsp;Variables&nbsp;used&nbsp;by&nbsp;Jetty
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;JETTY_HOME=\ABCD\empweb\jetty
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;JETTY_START=%EMPWEB_HOME%\common\etc\start.config
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;JETTY_CONSOLE=%JETTY_HOME%\logs\jetty&shy;console.log
</p>
<p>So the only line to observe is the first one, indicating the installation directory of Jetty.
</p>
<p> II.1.3 Java configuration
EmpWeb uses the 'Java Developers Kit' or JDK, which includes the 'javac' compiler, unlike the 
more commonly used Java Runtime Environment (JRE). EmpWeb works with both the Oracle Java 
JDK as with the OpenJDK, which are currently in their main version '7' (version '8' being on its 
way). In fact whenever the Jetty server has been restarted for some reason, the compilation of the 
script will be rather noticeable as the first execution of a script will take more time (seeming 'slow') 
while being compiled, but subsequent runs will be very fast.
</p>
<p>The only configuration to be done is to indicate into the EmpWeb launching scripts (empweb.sh or 
empweb.bat) the path to the Java-system and the Java-compiler : 
</p>
<p>e.g. in the Linux version : 
</p>
<p>#&nbsp;Java&nbsp;variables.
</p>
<p>JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/jdk"
</p>
<p>JAVA="$JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/java"
</p>
<p>or in the Windows version : 
</p>
<p>REM&nbsp;Java&nbsp;variables.
</p>
<p>p. 12</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;JAVA_HOME="\Program&nbsp;Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_45\bin"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;JAVA=%JAVA_HOME%\javaw.exe
</p>
<p> II.1.4 The CISIS-wrapper section
Again in the launching scripts of EmpWeb, the link to the CISIS-executable 'mx' is defined as to 
allow EmpWeb to indeed access ISIS-databases (for the catalogs and loanobjects, and optionally for
the users-database) :
</p>
<p>In Windows :  
</p>
<p>REM&nbsp;CISIS&nbsp;Wrapper
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;CISIS_LOCATION="\ABCD\www\cgi&shy;bin"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;CISIS_COMMAND="\mx"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;OS=win32
</p>
<p>NOTE : other than the previously mentioned parameters in the EmpWeb launching scripts, no other 
lines should be checked, except maybe the value for the maximum available memory for the Java-
environment in the 'Xmx'-part of the Java-settings, with higher/lower values to be set according to 
the available memory and the priority given to the EmpWeb application : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;set&nbsp;JAVA_OPTIONS=&shy;server&nbsp;&shy;DSTART=%JETTY_START%&nbsp;&shy;Djetty.home=%JETTY_HOME%&nbsp;

&shy;Xms128M&nbsp;&shy;Xmx128M&nbsp;&shy;Xincgc
</p>
<p>We now proceed with discussing the directories of the pre-installed EmpWeb system and 
specifically the parts there which are prone to configuration settings.
</p>
<p> II.2 Empweb installation proper
Again as with Jetty, EmpWeb comes pre-configured with the ABCD installation files, so in 
principle nothing has to be changed either for Windows or Linux in case ABCD is installed in its 
default directly-structure.
</p>
<p>However some 'localisation' parameters have to be checked, esp. when installing in non-standard 
ways.
</p>
<p>Configuration files for EmpWeb are mostly formatted as XML-files, so they can be edited with 
normal text-editors such as Notepad (Windows) or nano/gedit (Linux). 
</p>
<p>p. 13</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>The files to be observed will be discussed under here as they come in the pre-existing subdirectories
of the main EmpWeb-directory. We omit the many sub-directories with the actual coded software 
(.jar files as Java archives) and focus only on the files which have a meaning with respect to  
configuration/installation.
</p>
<p> II.2.1 Common
This is the directory where some general configuration files are found. In Windows they are not that
relevant but in Linux they could be moved into their dedicated own folders, e.g. the 'etc' folder 
contains the launching script empweb.sh in case you want it to be in the /etc folder with all software
configuration (as is meant to be in Linux). You don't need to change anything here and for someone 
knowing XML the configuration settings are quite easy to read, e.g. in the file 
</p>
<p>'ewdbws-jetty.xml' (for : empweb database web-services with jetty) the port is set to 8085 with the 
lines : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Call&nbsp;name="addListener"&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Arg&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;New&nbsp;class="org.mortbay.http.SocketListener"&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Set&nbsp;name="Port"&gt;8085&lt;/Set&gt;
</p>
<p>&hellip;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/arg&gt;
</p>
<p>In the sub-directory 'init.d' one can find a launch-script (as can be expected from the purpose of this 
folder in Linux /etc) for EmpWeb. It could be copied into the /etc/init.d folder for automatic start-up
of EmpWeb at boot-time.
</p>
<p> II.2.2 db
The 'db' subdirectory of EmpWeb serves to keep backups of the transaction-database (in SQL 
dump-format) named by the date-stamp automatically generated whenever re-initialising EmpWeb 
with the dedicated function in the Administration submodule. So one has to make sure that this 
folder is writable to the user associated with ABCD (e.g. www-data in Linux).
</p>
<p> II.2.3 dbws
This is the folder where EmpWeb keeps its 'web-services' configuration. Web-services are used to 
access the external users-databases while also here the configuration for the 'ISIS-driver' to access 
the catalog and loanobjects (mandatorily in ISIS-format) databases is defined.
</p>
<p>Therefore there are 2 relevant configuration files in the directory dbws/WEB-INF/conf : 
</p>
<p>&bull; isis_ABCD_usersconfig.xml
</p>
<p>&bull; isis_ABCDmarc_objectsconfig.xml
</p>
<p>p. 14</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>Remark : if other catalogs are added to the EmpWeb circulation system, they will also have their 
own configuration files named in the same naming-convention here, e.g. for a database 'BIBLO' one
would have the file 
</p>
<p>isis_ABCDbiblo_objectsconfig.xml.
</p>
<p>The catalog configuration file isis_ABCDmarc_objectsconfig.xml
In such a database-configuration file the most relevant part is the part indicating the location of the 
files :
</p>
<p>&lt;location&gt;/ABCD/www/bases/marc/data/&lt;/location&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;collection&gt;marc&lt;/collection&gt;
</p>
<p>&lt;join&gt;/ABCD/www/bases/loanobjects/data/loanobjects,959='MARC&shy;',v1&lt;/join&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;altlocation&gt;/ABCD/www/bases/loanobjects/data/&lt;/altlocation&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;altcollection&gt;loanobjects&lt;/altcollection&gt;
</p>
<p>&lt;altjoin&gt;/ABCD/www/bases/marc/data/marc,1/958='CN_'v1&lt;/altjoin&gt;
</p>
<p>As can be seen, the 'collection' attribute is the reference to the ABCD catalog database (e.g. marc). 
The join-attribute explains how mx (the CISIS-executable delivering the reply to the webservices 
request from EmpWeb to ISIS) can link from this catalog-database to the loanobjects database 
which holds all the objects of the loans-system. Actually mx uses the 'join=' parameter with the 
same data as provided here in the XML-attribute : 
</p>
<p>&bull; the name (and path) of the database
</p>
<p>&bull; the field tags to be considered for inclusion in the virtual catalog records at the time of 
creating the join (in our case : fields 1 up to 958)
</p>
<p>&bull; =CN_v1 is the exact key with which mx will identify the MFN from the joined database 
(loanobjects in our case), which means the join will be based on the prefix 'CN_' followed 
by the value of field 1 (the control number).
</p>
<p>Further on in this configuration file the 'mapping' of the catalog to MODS (the XML-format used in
the web-services process) is explained. MODS is used to reduce any catalog structure into the 
internal EmpWeb catalog-fields; this 'reduction' is called 'mapping'. There is no need to change 
anything in this mapping section, unless you need to work with non-standard ISIS-database 
structures, but because of this mapping in principle ANY catalog-structure can be used (as is a good
ISIS-principle).
</p>
<p>One example illustrates how this mapping puts the record-identifier as being the value of the main 
</p>
<p>p. 15</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>

<p>part (not a subfield) of v1 : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;xsl:template&nbsp;match="record"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;mods&nbsp;version="3.0"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;recordInfo&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;recordIdentifier&gt;&lt;xsl:value&shy;of&nbsp;
select="field[@tag='1']/occ/head"&nbsp;/&gt;&lt;/recordIdentifier&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/recordInfo&gt;
</p>
<p>Another example of this 'mapping' is the section to describe the author field (v100 in MARC). In 
this case the mapping goes to a subfield 'a' in the 'namePart' attribute :  
</p>
<p>&lt;xsl:for&shy;each&nbsp;select="field[@tag='100']/occ"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;name&nbsp;type="personal"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;namePart&gt;&lt;xsl:value&shy;of&nbsp;select="subfield[@name='a']"&nbsp;
/&gt;&lt;/namePart&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;role&gt;&lt;roleTerm&nbsp;type="text"&gt;author&lt;/roleTerm&gt;&lt;/role&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/name&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/xsl:for&shy;each&gt;
</p>
<p>Adding another catalog database to the EmpWeb system
</p>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, EmpWeb is pre-configured to work with the ABCD MARC21 
catalog database. However it is possible, fully in the general philosophy of ABCD, to add more 
catalogs if so desired in EmpWeb. How this is done is explained in the next section.
</p>
<p>For each additional catalog one has to create/edit an XML file for which the name indicates
the catalog name in between the name-parts 'isis_' and '_objectsconfig' : we use the 
example of a catalog named 'LILACS', so the configuration file will be named
'isis_LILACS_objectsconfig.xml'.
First of all we note that, as is the case for ALL ABCD-catalogs, all physical copies of the 
titles are registered into the common 'loanobjects'-database, with the details in the 
repeatable field v959.
The mapping of the fields to MODS-XML goes as follows (we only discuss the 'monograph'
-section of the actual LILACS-database) : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;titleInfo&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="field[@tag='18']/occ/head" /&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="field[@tag='19']/occ/head" /&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/titleInfo&gt;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
</p>
<p>As can be seen from the code above, the title is mapped to 2 occurrences (original and English title),
while authors are mapped to personal and institutional authors.
</p>
<p>In the following line the 'logical' internal name for the catalog is defined, in this case 'objects' : 
&lt;modsCollection dbname="objects"&nbsp;xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3"&gt;
</p>
<p>For the new LILACS catalog the following statements has to be added : 
&lt;modsCollection dbname="objetoslilacs"&nbsp;xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3"&gt;
</p>
<p>In the case of the users-database giving such a logical name was done as :
&lt;userCollection dbname="isis"&gt;

<p>In addition, when adding a extra catalog, the following addition has to be made to the file

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/service&gt;
</p>
<p>This informs the webservice that this source has to be included.
Finally the following lines have to be added to the file 'engineconf.xml' : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;base name="objetoslilacs" type="objects"&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;uri&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8085/ewdbws/services/LILACSObjectsService&lt;/uri&gt;

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/base&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This informs the EmpWeb webservice about the additional catalog to be used as a source 
for 'objects'-data. Accordingly the list of 'objects'-databases will then also mention the 
newly added catalog.  
This list allows either to search a specific catalog or all of the defined ones, in which case the results
will be mixed (as also done for the mixing of several users-databases).
</p>
<p> 
In the illustration above one can see that the first 'hit' is taken from the  MARC21 catalog, the 
second one however from the LILACS-catalog.
For the purpose of this 'multi-catalog' feature the name of the catalog (v10) has been added in the 
Control_Number (which is the identifier of catalog-records) extraction format of the FST of the 
loanobjects-database, to make sure each Control_Number indexed contains the name of the 
catalog : 
</p>
<p>1 0 "CN_"v10,"_"V1 
</p>
<p>1&nbsp;0&nbsp;"CONTROL_"V1&nbsp;
</p>
<p>959&nbsp;0&nbsp;(|IN_|V959^i|%|/)&nbsp;

<p>100&nbsp;0&nbsp;v10,'&shy;',v1&nbsp;

</p>
<p>310&nbsp;0&nbsp;if&nbsp;s(mpu,v10)='DBLIL'&nbsp;then&nbsp;(v959^i/)&nbsp;fi
</p>
<p>In the specific definition file for the new catalog (LILACS), the mapping is defined, e.g. :

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;field name="recordId" db="primary"&gt;903&lt;/field&gt;

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/query&gt;
</p>
<p>The copyID field is now taken from v310 (as opposed to v210 in MARC21).
</p>
<p>Needless to state that, as in all ABCD-catalog databases, this requires a unique identifier ('control 
number') to be present in the catalog-records, preferably created by a field with type 'auto-
incremental' (see the ABC of ABCD manual).
</p>
<p>the ISIS-users database configuration file isis_ABCD_usersconfig.xml
As in the previously discussed catalog-database configuration file, there are 2 parts : the location 
section and the mapping-section.
</p>
<p>The location of the users-database : 
</p>
<p>&lt;!&shy;&shy;&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;version&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;location&gt;/abcd/www/bases/users/data/&lt;/location&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;collection&gt;users&lt;/collection&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&shy;&shy;&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&lt;!&shy;&shy;&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;version&nbsp;&shy;&shy;&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;location&gt;/var/opt/ABCD/bases/users/data/&lt;/location&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;collection&gt;users&lt;/collection&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Note the use of 'remark' codes &lt;!-- and &ndash;&gt; which de-activates all text included. In the example 
above the Windows-version is 'commented-out' since this configuration is for the Linux-version.
</p>
<p>As was the case before for the 'objects' database, the XSL-coding in the second part produces the 
correct output-format in the expected XSL-schema. E.g. to denote the database-name to be 'isis' as 
will be used inside EmpWeb (e.g. when selecting users-databases available) : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;xsl:template&nbsp;match="/recordset"&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;userCollection&nbsp;dbname="isis"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;xsl:apply&shy;templates&nbsp;/&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/userCollection&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</p>
<p>Then the mapping is done for each field in each record. E.g. to explain that the expiration date is in 
the main part of v 18 : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;expirationDate&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value&shy;of&nbsp;
select="field[@tag='18']/occ/head"&nbsp;/&gt;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;/expirationDate&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>p. 19</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>The 'user-class' (or category) is put in v10, subfield a, as follows : 
</p>
<p>&lt;userClass&gt;&lt;xsl:value&shy;of&nbsp;select="field[@tag='10']/occ/subfield[@name='a']"
/&gt;&lt;/userClass&gt;
</p>
<p>In some cases, esp. when user-database have been converted from other external formats to ABCD, 
the user-class might not be in subfields, so then one has to change this line to : 
</p>
<p>&lt;userClass&gt;&lt;xsl:value&shy;of&nbsp;select="field[@tag='10']/occ/head]"&nbsp;
/&gt;&lt;/userClass&gt;
</p>
<p>In the final section of this configuration file the users-query is defined, now using the internal field-
codes for the EmpWeb user-records (e.g. userClass is now in v100) : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;query&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;field&nbsp;name="id"&nbsp;db="primary"&gt;350&lt;/field&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;field&nbsp;name="name"&nbsp;db="primary"&gt;300&lt;/field&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;field&nbsp;name="userClass"&nbsp;db="primary"&gt;100&lt;/field&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;field&nbsp;name="login"&nbsp;db="primary"&gt;600&lt;/field&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/query&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Other files in this directory dbws are not relevant for configuration purposes, but contain the 
necessary coding, e.g. the main Java &acute;archive' dbws.jar in dbws/lib.
</p>
<p> II.2.4 engine
The 'engine' directory deals with the non-webservices database access, i.e. the access to the 
dedicated EmpWeb-SQL databases and tables (transa and university).
</p>
<p>In the (standard) directory EmpWeb/engine/WEB-INF/conf one can find the most relevant 
configuration file : engineconf.xml . 
</p>
<p>This configuration file has 3 sections : the transactions names referencing their own XML-
instruction files, the database names with their URL's and the most important section when it comes
to installation : the actual definition of the SQL-database access.
</p>
<p>In the transactions section nothing has to be changed. A simple example illustrates how the loan-
transaction is defined referring to the loan.xml file in the trans-pipes sub-directory : 
</p>
<p>    &lt;transaction name="loan"              path="/engine/WEB-INF/conf/trans-pipes/loan.xml" /&gt;
</p>
<p>In the referenced XML-file one will find all specifications of the transaction concerned. E.g the 
loan-transaction itself has rules like this one : 
</p>
<p>if&nbsp;(operatorLocation&nbsp;!=&nbsp;biblioteca)&nbsp;

</p>
<p>This means that if the operator is not working in the library of the concerned book for the given 
transaction (in other words : the book does not belong to her/his library) an error message is given 
in Spanish (this is one of the few hard-coded error messages, but it can be changed here into 
English !)  :  Este objeto no pertenece a la biblioteca, sino que pertenece a la biblioteca which in 
English would be : this object does not belong to the library, but instead to the library : (after which 
the library name will be displayed to which the book belongs).
</p>
<p>In the databases section one should only note the name given as used within EmpWeb for each 
database, e.g. to denote the catalog as the 'objetos' database : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;base&nbsp;name="objetos"&nbsp;type="objects"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;uri&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8085/ewdbws/services/ABCDMarcObjectsService&lt;/uri&gt;&nbsp;
</p>

0.wsdl&lt;/wsdlFile&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/base&gt;
</p>
<p>A similar definition is given for the two users-database (the ISIS one and the SQL one).
</p>
<p>Finally the most relevant section is where the SQL-connection is defined. In the default example the
connection to the SQL-database for the transactions is defined as a MySQL database connection 
(with jdbc) at the 'localhost'  URL with the default MySQL port 3306 and opening the default 
EmpWeb transaction database 'transa' with user-name root and pas sword 'empweb' :
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;base&nbsp;name="TRANSA"&nbsp;type="transa"&gt;&nbsp;

<p>Needless to say that here one can change the values to connect to either another JDBC-compatible 
SQL-database (e.g Postgres, Oracle...) at the same or an external SQL-server with other credentials. 
</p>
<p>This is a very interesting feature as it shows that EmpWeb can connect to external SQL-databases 
where the transactions can be managed.  Later on we will see also external user-databases can be 
accessed, e.g. tables maintained in the Registration Office of an institution.
</p>
<p>As the login data for the SQL-database are given here, please make sure the SQL-database used will
accept them. 
</p>
<p>Another important parameter here is the directory where EmpWeb will create the backups 
(backupDir). If this directory is not writable to the user under which ABCD is running (e.g. www-
data) then simply &ndash; without unfortunately any warning &hellip; - the 'engine' or the SQL-access won't 
work at all. It is a detail but an annoying one when wrong !
</p>
<p> II.2.5 gui
This is the directory with the actual jsp files building the Graphical Users Interface.
</p>
<p>p. 22</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>The initial  JSP is login.jspf, where the EmpWeb page is built with other jsp's, e.g. relevant for 
localisation are : 
</p>
<p>institution.jspf where the 'header' of the page is defined with instutional data : 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&nbsp;id="identification"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt;ABCD&lt;/h1&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&nbsp;Loans&nbsp;Module&lt;/h2&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;
</p>
<p>This example will give 'ABCD' as the main name on top of the page, with 'Advanced Lons Module' 
on the second line. Changing these values will immediately have a major 'localisation&acute;  impact !
</p>
<p>Coda.jspf defines what will happen after logging out : 
</p>
<p>&lt;%&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;request.setAttribute("abcd",System.getProperty("abcd.url",&nbsp;
"/").concat("/what.php?action=getall"));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>%&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In this case the ABCD URL (as defined in the EmpWeb launching script) with the what.php script 
will be invoked. No need to change this at all.
</p>
<p>In the WEB-INF/conf sub-directory of GUI one will find the important file 'config.properties', 
which exceptionally is not an XML-file but simply defines variables, e.g. : 
</p>
<p>gui.default_locale=en_CL_UCV&nbsp;
</p>
<p>gui.languages=es_CL_UCV,en_CL_UCV,fr_CK_UCV,pt_CL_UCV&nbsp;
</p>
<p>gui.hide_languages=false
</p>
<p>This example is taken from the configuration for the CL_UCV (a piloting EmpWeb user institution 
in Chile), putting English as the default language and defining es, en, fr and pt as the available 
languages. These languages are shown and selectable in the interface by putting the 'hide' parameter
to false.
</p>
<p>Many more parameters can be set here, e.g. 
</p>
<p>ew.hide_user_db=false
</p>
<p>will NOT hide the selection list for users-databases, but obviously can also be set to 'true' to actually
hide this part of the interface when doing a query or transaction.
</p>
<p>Daring EmpWeb managers could experiment freely here without a lot of risks, as long as one 
remembers where one has changed what - when it is better to return to the default status.
</p>
<p>For the actual version of EmpWeb, i.e. version 18n, the directory WEB-INF/conf/ewi18n contains 
the language-dependent interface elements, which therefore can be adjusted 'a volont&eacute;'.
</p>
<p>The core-subfolder contains for the default language as well as the other defined languages the 
</p>
<p>p. 23</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>messages on the screen, and therefore can be used to create other language versions or versions with
adjusted wordings.
</p>
<p>Each message-name is given, after the '=', the actual value to be shown, like very simply \
</p>
<p>yes=Yes&nbsp;
</p>
<p>means that in the default language (the file 'gui-properties' ) the message 'yes' will be worded as 
'Yes'.
</p>
<p>For the Spanish language this file is called 'gui_es.properties' whereas there are also files containing
messages for other modules of EmpWeb like 'engine.properties' (for the SQL-part), 
'ew14dbws.properties' for the ISIS web-services part) and 'process.properties' (the transactions 
part).
</p>
<p>Creating a new language version of EmpWeb would mean to duplicate all these files with the proper
language indicator (e.g. 'am' could be used to create an Amharic version for Ethiopia) and translate 
all the values after the '=' for each message used. Then in the main 'config.properties' file the prefix 
for the language has to be added in order to include it into the interface for selection in the 
gui.languages variable where it can be added in the desired sequence of languages.
</p>
<p>In the 'local' subdirectory of  WEB-INF/conf/ewi18n one will find the same lists of language-
dependent variables (or screen-messages) for the 'rules' of the loans-system (the policies), e.g. 
</p>
<p>loanHours=N&uacute;mero&nbsp;de&nbsp;horas&nbsp;para&nbsp;emprestar&nbsp;um&nbsp;item.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>in the file 'limits_pt.properties' will define the Portuguese message to be used to explain the 'number
of hours an item can be loaned' in the rules-definition window of EmpWeb. If one understands this 
logic one can again translate or adjust all on-screen-visible messages for any language or indeed 
create a new one.
</p>
<p>Finally there is the directory gui/WEB-INF/conf/auth where the users, the groups they belong to 
and the authorized actions per group are listed in XML-format.
</p>
<p>Users.xml : 
</p>
<p>The user-data are listed for each user created in EmpWeb, including the password which is readable 
here if set to 'raw' (= non-encrypted).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;user&nbsp;id="egbert"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;username&gt;De&nbsp;Smet,&nbsp;Egbert&lt;/username&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;password&nbsp;encoding="raw"&gt;egbert&lt;/password&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;email&gt;egbert@ac.be&lt;/email&gt;&nbsp;

<p>A 'group' is a set of actions with the user ID's allowed to enter :

<p>&nbsp;&lt;group&nbsp;id="home"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;user&nbsp;id="admin"&nbsp;/&gt;&nbsp;

</p>
<p>defines the 'home' group (working on the main home-page) with the list of users who have access 
there (in the demo-installation).

<p>Another example of a group, i.e. the query on a transaction :

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/group&gt;
</p>
<p>As one can see here not all defined users can do this type of action.
</p>
<p>Properties.xml : 
</p>
<p>This file lists all users with the parameters (properties) set in their profile :

</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>This file is checked whenever a user logs in and defines the further behavior of EmpWeb, e.g. if a 
list of IP-numbers is set (see infra, creation of operators), and the user tries to log in from a non-
included IP-number, the login will be rejected (as can be seen from the resulting error URL).
</p>
<p>The use of 'tags' in EmpWeb GUI-folder
Most if not all EmpWeb screens use 'tags' or often-used screen elements, called from the transaction
definitions and actually defined in the (sub-)folder(s of) /[empweb]/gui/tags.
</p>
<p>E.g. the script 'record_status_result.jsp' calls, amongst others, the 'display' tags-folder :
</p>
<p>&lt;%@ taglib prefix="dsp" tagdir="/WEB-INF/tags/display" %&gt;
</p>
<p>in which the 'user.tag' file describes how to display the user-info, e.g. for the user-picture :
</p>
<p>&lt;table&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&nbsp;rowspan="4"&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img&nbsp;src="${abcd}photoproxy.php?imgid=users/$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{userInfo['u:photo']}"&nbsp;alt="PICTURE"/&gt;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>[etc.]
</p>
<p>followed by more such html-formatted elements like user-class, contact-email, expiration-date etc.
</p>
<p>So this is where quite some graphical elements or building blocks of the screens can be adapted if 
so desired.
</p>
<p>NOTE on the style-sheets used in EmpWeb 
</p>
<p>In the subfolder 'resources/css' of the GUI-folder the CSS-files are available. These have been 
adopted from the general ABCD-stylesheets (in ABCD/www/htdocs/central/css). Actually the 
following CSS are used (and can be changed if so desired) : 
</p>
<p>template.css (inherited from the ABCD, importing styles y layout)
</p>
<p>styles.css (idem)
</p>
<p>layout.css (idem)
</p>
<p>java.css  (required for the editing of Groovy scripts)
</p>
<p>codepress.css (required for the editing of Groovy scripts)

<p>Multi-linguality in EmpWeb
</p>
<p>p. 26</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>EmpWeb has been designed as a multi-lingual software, currently in 4 languages (English, Spanish, 
Portuguese and French), in which more languages can be added.
</p>
<p>First of all the languages used are defined in the file /[empweb]/gui/WEB-ING-
conf/config.properties, originally (first version) with Spanish, English, later on Portuguese and 
French were added. See the following lines of that configuration-file : 
</p>
<p>#&nbsp;web&nbsp;service&nbsp;locations&nbsp;
</p>
<p>ewengine.query_service=http://localhost:8086/ewengine/services/EmpwebQuery
Service&nbsp;
</p>
<p>ewengine.admin_service=http://localhost:8086/ewengine/services/EmpwebAdmin
Service&nbsp;
</p>
<p>ewengine.trans_service=http://localhost:8086/ewengine/services/EmpwebTrans
actionService&nbsp;
</p>
<p>#&nbsp;locales&nbsp;
</p>
<p>gui.default_locale=en_CL_UCV&nbsp;
</p>
<p>gui.languages=es_CL_UCV,en_CL_UCV,fr_CK_UCV,pt_CL_UCV&nbsp;
</p>
<p>gui.hide_languages=false&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Secondly, the actual language-sensitive messages used in the EmpWeb system are taken from the 
files in the subfolder /[empweb]/gui/WEB-INF/conf/ew18n/, where two subfolders exist : local and 
core.
</p>
<p>In these subfolders EmpWeb uses text-files, named with first the module (e.g. display, engine, 
gui...) followed by an underscore and the language-code (except for the default 'English' where the 
language-code is simply omitted). All these files have the '.properties' extension.
</p>
<p>E.g. the file 'gui.properties' in the 'core'-subfolder contains the English (since no language code) 
messages for the GUI-module, such as the institution-name, login/password, submit-texts and many
others. The file 'gui-es.properties' contains the same messages but in Spanish.
</p>
<p>An example from the 'local'-subfolder is the file display.properties where messages are translated 
from their internal variable-reference to &ndash; in this case &ndash; the English translation, e.g. 
</p>
<p>loan_info=Loan&nbsp;Information
</p>
<p>operator_id=Operator
</p>
<p>etc.
</p>
<p>This means that by editing these files, i.e. changing the 'translations', one can adjust the interface 
with different wordings. 
</p>
<p>Adding a new language would then involve the following steps : 
</p>
<p>1. add a language-code in the file config.properties in the 'locales' section following the model 
for other languages. If one e.g. would add a 'kiSwahili' version with code SW and have it as 
</p>
<p>p. 27</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>the default language, the lines would read as : 
</p>
<p>#&nbsp;locales&nbsp;
</p>
<p>gui.default_locale=am_CL_UCV&nbsp;
</p>
<p>gui.languages=am_CL_UCV,es_CL_UCV,en_CL_UCV,fr_CK_UCV,pt_CL_UCV&nbsp;
</p>
<p>gui.hide_languages=false&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2. copy all files in both the 'core' and 'local' subfolders or ONE language that will serve as the 
'original' one from which to translate (e.g. English, so the files without a language-code in 
the naming) to the same file-names but with the language-code chosen (e.g. 'am' for 
Amharic).
</p>
<p>3. Translate into the newly created files all parts after the '=' into the new language, leaving the 
original value before the '=' unaltered.
</p>
<p>After this last step you have to re-load the system (restart Jetty with the 'empweb.sh' or 
empweb.bat script) and you will from then on have the new language available.

<p>III.Using EmpWeb
</p>
<p> III.1 System configuration
</p>
<p> III.1.1 Initiating EmpWeb. 
 
After activating ABCD_start to actually launch Apache 'listening to' port 9090, 
enter the URL http://localhost:9090/empweb/ in your browser. Remember to add the 
final slash to the address, or EmpWeb will not work properly. 
Note that Jetty is configured to listen to port 8080 (as typical for Java Servlets), 
but the following lines in the Apache-configuration file for ABCD have been 
added to 're-route' port 8080 to 9090 : 
</p>
<p>ProxyPass /empweb/ http://127.0.0.1:8080/empweb/ 
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
</p>
<p>After a few seconds (remember if this is the first time EmpWeb runs after the 
launch of the Jetty-server a compilation process will slow down the system)  the
main login page of EmpWeb will open. 
</p>
<p> 
 
 
</p>
<p>Enter the demo administrator data  (admin/empweb) and press Submit.

<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p> 
A second login page will be displayed, where you should select a library, since 
EmpWeb can manage a multitude of libraries or library-branches. This step is 
necessary only for users with access privileges to more than one library.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Select the library you will work in and press Submit. The EmpWeb application 
will now open.
 
</p>
<p>This will put you into the system, with the main menu of the transactions

upper-right corner as links.
</p>
<p>Before discussing the intentionally 'simple' use of the transactions themselves, 
we first have to discuss the many system-management issues at stake, which 
should typically be addressed before the system can be used indeed.
</p>
<p> III.1.2 Main initialisation of the EmpWeb SQL-tables
From here on we will assume the SQL-database used is MySQL, but generally 
speaking other SQL-databases won't be much different in their usage.
 
EmpWeb uses 2 databases in the selected SQL-environment : 
</p>
<p>&bull; university : this database contains two tables (users and user-types) and 
is used to store circulation-system users with their main characteristics 
</p>
<p>p. 31</p>

<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>(name, ID, category...) and the user-types or categories
</p>
<p>&bull; transa : the main database where all transactions will be stored into their 
proper tables.
</p>
<p>The university database
This database has only 2 tables, as can be shown by MySQL through the 
commands 'use university' (to select that database) and 'show tables' (after 
having logged in into MySQL-command-line modus) :
</p>
<p>To initialise the 'university' database, it is a good idea to load the structure with
some sample data (for users) from the file 'university.sql', which can be found 
in the extras-directory of the EmpWeb installation folder. This can be done 
either by e.g. PHPMyAdmin or with a simple command :
</p>
<p>MySQL&gt;&nbsp;source&nbsp;/opt/ABCD/empweb/extras/university.sql;
</p>
<p>which will show the following output :

<p>Now 4 demo-users are available, listed by the command

<p>After accessing EmpWeb with the system-administration login, the main 
Transactions page will open but also giving access to the 'Administration' 
options, and you must perform a very important step before being able to use 
EmpWeb for the first time, i.e. initialising the transactions database.
</p>
<p>In order to initialise the transactions database, go to the Administration menu, 
select the Databases (Bases) sub-menu and a initialisation 
Confirmation/Warning window will appear. Confirm the operation by clicking 
YES. 
</p>
<p>If the process is successful, you will receive a confirmation message.
</p>
<p>This means that the 'engine' has successfully accessed the SQL-database for 
storage of the transactions, requiring your SQL-database server to run and the 
parameters (in engine.conf.xml) to be correct. The transa-database is now 
available but without any data.
Initialising this database will cause EmpWeb to automatically create a 'dump' of
the database in the directory defined as the 'backup-'directory (see supra) in a 
file named after the date/time-stamp with extension .sql. This is a backup 
indeed as it can also be restored into MySQL with a 'source'-command.

<p>Back at the main Transactions page, you will now see that a 0 (null) figure has

<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual

<p>appeared at the right of each Status item, confirming that the 'transa' database
has been activated.
</p>
<p>NOTE : Database initialisation problems.
If you had a previous MySql installation on your computer, in Windows the old 
root/password and other configuration data remains in the system (somewhere 
in your 'users'-folders) even if you delete the Program Files\MySql folder 
completely, and may affect the functioning of EmpWeb, including the 
initialisation of the 'transa' database.
</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to open a console, invoke mysql and manually 
drop the database:
</p>
<p>1- Open a cmd window. 
2- Execute the command  mysql &ndash;uroot &ndash;p&nbsp;&nbsp;(press Enter)
3- *** insert the password *** (type the password 'empweb') (press Enter)
4- mysql&gt; DROP DATABASE transa;  (press Enter)
5- mysql&gt; quit; (press Enter)
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>After doing this, you will be able to initialise the mysql database from EmpWeb.
  
</p>
<p> NOTE : Manual configuration of EmpWeb under MySql.
 
In order to configure the root user account manually, you have to edit the 
file  /ABCD/empweb/engine/WEB-INF/conf/engineconf.xml. Use a text editor like 
Notepad for this. Locate line 150 and from there on you will find the following 
content:

<p>Change &lt;user&gt; and &lt;password&gt; and save the file. For the changes to have

ABCD_start.bat
</p>
<p>At this time it might also be a good idea to check the value for the  backupDir-
variable : if that directory (or 'folder' in Windows) is not writeable for the 
EmpWeb-user, the initialisation will &ndash; without any useful error-message &ndash; not 
work !

<p> III.1.3 Configuration of libraries
 
The steps to configure libraries in EmpWeb are the following:
1. Change the library definition in the conf-getLibraries pipeline.
2. Change global parameters of the library in the globalenvironment 
pipeline.
3. Assign user rights to access these libraries (or branches).
 
</p>
<p>Change the library definitions in 'globalenvironment' 
pipeline
After starting the EmpWeb application, select Administration -&gt; Pipelines and a

</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>screen appears with the title Transaction Pipelines Administration (similar to the
figure below) where you will see the first two options.
 In the first option the system-administrator has to define the libraries or branches which will be 
administered by EmpWeb. The interface actually provides a text-editor on the file '[empweb-
home]/engine/WEB_INF/conf/conf-pipes/globalenvironment.xml', which &ndash; as is the case with other
such configuration text-files - is mostly consisting of comment-lines (starting with '//') to explain the
use but towards the end contains the most relevant section where the libraries and for each of these 
the latest time at the day when short-loans can be initiated (maxHourForLoanByHour) are defined : 
</p>
<p>p. 37</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>In this example we can see that the libraries ING, ARQ, AGR y VET are 
configured. The part of the library names 'pucvua.', preceding the actual library
name abbreviation, is inherited from the piloting institution, but only the actual 
names will be used for selecting a library later on.
Some other 'hours' can also be defined, optionally, for each library, e.g. the 
starting hour for reservations or the latest hours for returning books, for each 
library individually.  
By default in EmpWeb, 15pm is configured to be the limit for returns at the 
date due; if preferred this time-table can be adjusted from the same menu 
Administration, Pipelines and this configuration-file. Returns processed from 
15p.m. will be considered as late and subject to sanctions (fines or suspension) 
according to the user profile.
</p>
<p>Change the library definitions in conf-getLibraries pipeline
In the second pipe-line option 'Conf_getLibraries' two additional characteristics are defined for each
library in the network : the IP-numbers (or ranges, like e.g. '*' - for any IP-number &ndash; in the example 
below) and the opening-hours.
In the illustration below this is again done for 4 library-branches of a university-library : ING, ARQ,
AGR and VET.

</p>
<p>Assigning user rights to the system.
After defining the libraries which populate the system in EmpWeb, you must 
establish the necessary permissions for the users to access EmpWeb. The 
permissions will only have effect as of the next session.
Go to the EmpWeb Administration menu - &gt; Operators. Select the &ldquo;super user&rdquo; 
with access to all applications &ndash; in this case the user abcd who has full 
administrator privileges.
From this access you can create new users and assign the corresponding rights.
It is also possible to edit, modify or delete existing users, as shown in the next 
image.
 
By editing the system-administrator admin (case-sensitive !), you gain access 
to the library definitions and can assign the new access permits to each.
  
Warning: Remember to save the changes clicking on the Submit button for 
each group, or the new settings will not have effect.
 
Once you have assigned the new access permissions to the libraries, you must 
logout from the system (without closing EmpWeb).
Login again, and now you will see the list of available libraries assigned to the 
current user/password.
 
</p>
<p> III.1.4  Administration of calendars in EmpWeb.
The administration of calendars for the loan transactions and returns in 
EmpWeb is global for the whole system and all libraries, so we can define all 
the calendars for each year. For this we need to enter into the option 
Administration / Calendars. 
When editing a calendar, a frame is presented in which the rows correspond to 
months and the columns to the days.
Ticking the boxes for each day of the month we can define the non-working 
days to be taken into account by the system. Each holiday or non-working day 
will be skipped when the system calculates the latest return-day for a loan or 
pick-up date for a reservation. 
Without having defined the calendars, no transaction will be granted since then
the system has no information on these days-to-skip !

<p> III.1.5  Creation of new operators.
It is crucial to analyze correctly the operations assigned to each EmpWeb 
operator in order to assign the necessary permissions which give access to the 
different databases and operations. 
After entering with the system-administrator login data a second window is 
presented for selection of the library within which will be worked.
 
Warning: to create or modify operators one has to take into account the 
necessary permissions for such operations; in this case the user 
admin/empweb has the adequate permissions.
From the function administration, we can access the menu 'operators' which 
lists the operators already defined and offers the functions for 
editing/copying/deleting existing users on top of the creation of new operators. 
Such a list is shown in the picture below, along with all operations (presented 
as links) which can be performed on each operator (or staff-member) : edit, 
copy or delete.
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>Creating a new operator
When creating a new operator, the first thing requested is the operator's ID to 
be used for login into EmpWeb; subsequently a window will be presented with 
several sections.
These sections are :   
1- information on the operator; 
2- IP from where access will be granted; 
</p>
<p>p. 41</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>3- libraries which can be accessed and their operating hours, 
4- links to operations and permissions;  
5- and finally the properties or permissions to search in the user and 
loanobjects databases.
Each section has a button SUBMIT to be used each time permissions in the 
section have been defined.
 
After the creation of an operator has been confirmed, we still need to enter the 
details of the operator account, the IP's authorized to enter from and the 
assigned permissions. 
  
Defining the IP's from which the operator can access, adds additional security 
to the one based on the login data (login/password) since the user/operator will
only be allowed to enter from this specific library or IP.  Also it is possible to 
enter an IP from which the operator can access in the List of IP Addresses or to 
enter more addresses separated by a semi-colon (;).
The access 'Anywhere' means allow access from any computer on the internet.
In the following section of the operator's profile we need to define on which 
library an operator has rights to operate and whether operations are confined 
by the operating hours table or not.
</p>
<p>Membership of the operator groups and permissions assignment
In the next section we have to indicate which are the actions for which the 
operator has permission. The action 'enter Home' always needs to be permitted
as without it an operator cannot do anything.
 
In the last section of the permissions window (see next picture) the database(s)
of loanobjects and users which can be administered are to be indicated. At the 
time of realizing a transaction access to one or all databases will be needed. 
 
</p>
<p>p. 42</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>As a result of such operator profile definition, when an operator tries to enter a 
transaction for which the necessary authorisation has not been given, EmpWeb
will show an error message informing that the operator is not properly 
authorized.

<p> III.1.6  Linking the ABCD-users and Loanobjects databases. 
 
The user-databases, be it the externally managed 'SQL' user-tables or the 
internally managed ISIS users-database, are shared by all libraries in EmpWeb; 
when having entered as a system administrator it will be possible to consult 
the existing users in both databases either as a specific 'query' in the 
dedicated menu or when clicking on 'search' at a transaction screen. 
The actual query screen of EmpWeb allows querying users, objects and 
transactions; in the illustration here already a search for 'all users' is filled in by
using the ISIS-truncation mark '$' without anything else (which is a bad idea 
when dealing with large user-databases !), in this case to illustrate the list of 
sample-users from both the SQL and ISIS-databases : 
</p>
<p> 
 When clicking on 'Search User' (in 'Search all' databases mode), the following sample users will be 
shown : 
</p>
<p> Looking at this list more carefully, one can note that : 
1. 4 users from the SQL-users table are listed
2. 3 users from the ISIS-demo users-database are listed, but with expiry dates already passed.
</p>
<p>In this case no ISIS-users can be served, as they will only be taken into account when they are still 
</p>
<p>p. 44</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>'valid' according to their expiry-date. So the ABCD Central users-database has to be edited in order 
to update the actual expiry dates
  
The system manages transactions based on the user ID, so that if the user ID is
known (e.g. by scanning the barcode on the ID) we enter it into the dedicated 
field and there is no need to perform a search.  Such could be done by typing 
or reading by barcode reader &ndash; or any other similar device.
When the user ID is not known, a search is to be done using the ISIS-search 
technology; for this we enter the first characters followed by the ISIS-truncation
($)m, e.g. 'guilart$', and pressing the button 'search' will locate the user(s) who
fit the search expression.
Any record fitting the search expression will be displayed; the correct entry will 
be selected by clicking on the user ID field and this then will be passed to the 
loans form for further processing.
 
</p>
<p> Create a new user.
For creation of a new user from ABCD we need to enter the Database 
Administration module (ABCD Central) and select the users database (a demo 
database is included with the EmpWeb distribution).
 
 
The option Data Entry allows to enter a new user in the database with the 
following fields :
</p>
<p>User type (based on the list of user types defined in Usuarios.TAB in the folder DEF of 
the user-database)
sex male/female, 
expiry date (refers to the date until which the user will be considered active);
expiry date in ISO date format (automatically created by the system)
user code;
Names;
ID-card;
Affiliation
campus/brach
Adm.  Level 1
Adm.  Level 2
Physical Address
Mail Address
City
</p>
<p>p. 45</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Country
Telephone
Fax
E-mail
Login to access Mysite
Password to access Mysite
Picture 4x4
</p>
<p> 
In this distribution of EmpWeb the user_ID is extracted from field 10 from the 
user records or a SQL table called user_type which is linked e.g. from MySQL.
It is possible to configure the link to the users database from any field or 
combination of fields where the data can be extracted.
 
Editing the user record in ABCD-Central also allows uploading a picture to be 
included in the user-record. When we proceed with saving the record, by 
clicking on the 'diskette' icon at the bottom of the form, the user will 
immediately be activated and can loan materials from the library to which he is
linked.
When we access user-data from EmpWeb, clicking on the ID field it can be seen
that the complete profile includes the picture plus the active loans and other 
information. 
</p>
<p>Loanobjects and the loanobjects database
The loanobjects in this EmpWeb distribution are linked to the MARC 
bibliographic database and when we view the records we can know whether 
there are copies available by clicknig the button which is shown at the left of 
each record. 
This action of consulting item availability, will allow making reservations; at this
stage the user will have to enter his/her login data for the reservation 
registration.
 
</p>
<p>p. 46</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>; 
 
This database LOANOBJECTS has a field 'Control Number' which links the record
with the bibliographic database (MARC); also there is a field to identify the 
name of the bibliographic database (as there can be many in one Loans 
system) and finally there is a repeatable field in which the data of each copy 
are entered into the respective subfields for ID, library, shelf,  part and volume 
no. and object type (subfields i, l, b, v and t).
 
To make a return transaction is simple : we enter the Transactions module and 
put the ID of the copy to return; when clicking the button 'process return' some 
information about the success (or not) of the return transaction will be given 
and this will immediately be reflected in the item status of the library and the 
information of the MySite fuction.

<p> III.1.7 Definition of policies
</p>
<p>Policies as basically sets of profiles, of which only one can be 'active'. A good practice is by starting
with a 'general' or default policy with which the library circulation system can start operating, then 
as needs or ideas to make the system more sophisticated, to add new policies and activate then 
whenever needed. 
</p>
<p> III.1.8 Definition of profiles by user type and object type.
To define the treatment which EmpWeb has to apply to each user type and 
loanobjects type, profiles are used.
 
A policy involves a set of profiles and each profile is a combination of user type 
with object type.
When editing the current policy, we will see that in reality in the installation 
package contains only one profile only which is applied to any object type and 
any user type, as indicated by the asteric (*), for the time being.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>When we edit a profile, by clicking on the link 'Edit objects category' (as seen in
the previous illustration), we can see all the parameters applied in each 
transaction. 
There are quite many such parameters indeed, again showing the 'advanced' 
idea of EmpWeb as a circulation manager. Not all of them have to be used and 
some can therefore be left empty.
 
</p>
<p> Components of a profile.
A profile is based on four columns : the name of the parameter, the value of 
the parameter, the description and the transactions affected by this parameter.
 
</p>
<p>In the profile currently being edited, applied to all user types and object types, 
we can observe the following based on the four columns : 
no fine created when a return is late (False)
</p>
<p>fine created when a user cancels a confirmed reservation (True)
</p>
<p>no fine created when a user has a reservation which expires (False) 
</p>
<p>suspension created when an item is returned late (True)
</p>
<p>no suspension is created when a user has a reservation which expires (False) 
</p>
<p>the maximum number of days to wait for a user to collect a reserved item is
put at 3
</p>
<p>p. 50</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>fine amount for a confirmed reservation not taken (5)
</p>
<p> (multiplicator of)  the fine when a reservation expires and the item has no
other reservations(1)
</p>
<p> fine amount when a reservation expires and other users have reserved the
same item (2)
</p>
<p>Summarizing this section defines all parameters and limits applied on each of 
the transactions.
For example, the number of days for a loan for any object and user type is put 
at 5 in the last parameter shown in the illustration below :
</p>
<p> Creation of a new profile 
When we need to define a new profile of a policy, we need to enter 
Administration &ndash; Policies, Edit policy (in this case Active Default, Edit, Create 
New Profile) and in there a new profile can be created. 
E.g. when we want to create a new profile for the user type 'coordinators', we 
must identify the user category as 'coordinators' and the object type (e.g. 
CDROM).
</p>
<p> 
In the window we must define each of the parameters and limits until all values
are defined with TRUE or FALSE or a number. 
E.g. to illustrate again the use of circulation rules parameters we list all of them
for a specific profile :
</p>
<p>p. 51</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>- no fine created when an item is returned late or no fines used at all (False)
- suspension created when an object is returned late (True)
- no suspenion is created when a user has a reservation expired (False)
- number of days during which the user can collect the reserved item is put at 3.
- Fine amount (multiplicator) when an object is returned late without other reservations : 
0. 
- Fine amount (multiplicator) when an object is returned late and other reservations are 
noted : 0 
- The number of days the loan lasts for this object (which can be absolute days or library 
days, as defined in the transaction). In this case put at 15. 
- Total maximum fine a user can accumulate without losing the possibility to loan.  Here it
is  0 since no fine system is used. 
- Maximum number of fines a user can have without losing the right ot loan. Left at 0 
here.
- Maximum number of fines a user can have without losing the right to make reservations
: 0
- Maximum number of loans allowe when user has fine : 0
- If the user has late returns how many new loans will be allowed ? Leave at 0
- Max. Number of loans allowed when user has suspension. Left at 0 implies that when 
suspended a user cannot have loans anymore. 
- Maximum number of loans of the same object category, put at 2, meaning only two 
CDROMS can be taken at the same time
- Maximum no. of loans for the same volume/part item, put here at 1
- Maximum no. of loans this user can have in total, here put at 7
- Maximum no. of renewals for this user, put at 3, meaning that 3 renewals are allowed, 
but from MySite only 2 will be allowed.
- Maximum number of reservations if the user has fines, so in this case 0 since no fine 
system is used here.
- Maximum number of reservations if the user has late returns : no reservations are 
allowed with delayed returns
- Maximum no. of reservations if the user has suspension running, 0 means that the a 
suspended user cannot take any reservation
- Maximum no. of reservations for objects of this category. Same as the value for loans 
and same for reservations of the same type of objects
- Maximum no. of reservations for the same record, same case of 1 for laons would be 
the same case applied for volume/part. [???]
- Maximum no. of reservations allowed in total, in this case put at 5 
- Suspension days when a reservation expires, in this case we do not apply suspension 
days, so 0 whether there are reservations or not
- When an item is returned late without having reservations, 4 days of suspension will be 
applied.

</p>
<p>Application of  a profile. 
Once a profile has been edited clicking on SUBMIT will apply the profile on the 
new transactions.  Remember that there should be loanobjects available for 
loaning and also a user category corresponding to the profile. This last issue is 
particularly important and often not easy to assure, esp. when users have been
imported from other sources. Whenever EmpWeb doesn't recognize a user-
category no transactions with that user will be possible ! Also when the user-
category cannot be retrieved (check e.g the 'mapping' of the user-fields in the 
file /[empweb]/dbws/WEB-INF/conf/isis_ABCD_usersconfig.xml) an error 
message mentioning this condition will be shown.

<p> III.2 Using the daily transactions
</p>
<p> III.2.1 Checking the availability of a book 
The EmpWeb installation package is pre-defined to do lending transactions with
the MARC bibliographic database. 
When you go to MySite (e.g. in a 'localhost' installation for testing : 
http://localhost:9090/site) and access the MARC database directly, if you do a 
successful search an Availability button will appear at the left of each item 
registered as a loan object. The association is done with the Control Number 
field as key.
 
Click the Availability button and a window opens displaying the available copies
of the selected record. 
 
Click the Availability button and the existing copies are shown.
</p>
<p>As you can see, it is possible to make a reservation of this item clicking the 
Place Reservation button. This will open the MySite page to execute the 
reservation. The program will ask for login/password to access the Users 
database.
 
To have access to the Users (or patrons) database you must go to the main 
ABCD page (localhost:9090/) and login as a user with Loans Administrator 
profile. In the database you can Edit/Create/Modify users applying the 
necessary permissions to access MySite.
 
 
 
 
The loanobjects database was included in this distro to be shown as one of the 
editable databases in ABCD for testing purposes only. Remember that 
loanobjects is an internal database administered by ABCD and is not supposed 
to be directly edited by the final user.
 
 
By editing the records you can load data in the different fields. Field 001 is the 
ID-unique identifier for the record; field 10 is the database name (MARC in our 
case) and the repeatable field 959 contains the unique identifier for each

</p>
<p> III.2.2  Reservations  with EmpWeb.
Reservations can be made fron 2 access points : MySite or as another 
transaction from the operator's EmpWeb interface. 
 
Consulting the availability of items for a selected loanobject, one can reserve it 
from MySite; the system will allow to make the reservation when the requested 
title does not have copies available and in addition the user complies with the 
user-profile defined conditions (e.g. not being suspended).
 
When making a reservation if copies are available, the system does not allow 
to make this reservation but will indicate that an available copy has to be 
collected from the library. 
</p>
<p>When we go to MySite we can see that the status now indicates that the 
reservation has been done today and which title has been reserved. 
 
Now we can record a return transaction of an item with reservation, this 
information will be reflected immediately in the waiting list of reservations of 
the principal EmpWeb window
 
When we try to realize a loan on this item which has a reservation by another 
user, EmpWeb informs us that the number of running loans do not suffice for 
the confirmed reservations in order to allow this transaction. So an reserved 
item will not be issued on loan.
 
Automatically in the MySite page of the user the availability of the reserved 
item will be reflected and also it will give information on the number of days it 
</p>
<p>p. 55</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>will remain reserved to be collected. This number of days to be available for 
collection by the user will be taken  from the EmpWeb policy.
At the time of creating a loans transaction or canceling a reservation, the 
information in the main EmpWeb page will be updated with the actual status of 
the transactions.
 
</p>
<p> III.2.3  Issuing a book
Putting a book on loan, or issuing it, is of course the most basic operation of any loans-system. The 
idea is to keep this as simple as possible in view of the potentially (very) high 'traffic' or number of 
such transactions to be performed every day, often also simultaneously from several work-posts or 
issueing desks in librarie branches.
</p>
<p>Since EmpWeb avoids the overhead of a 'document oriented' database like ISIS but simply uses the 
matrix-based model of a relational database with just a few tables, such performance can be 
considered to be quite high.
</p>
<p>The actual ergonomics are kept to a minimum : 
</p>
<p>&bull; identifying the object, preferably with a barcode-scanner
</p>
<p>&bull; identifying the user, again preferably with a barcode-scanner
</p>
<p>&bull; and clicking on 'process loan'
</p>
<p>will trigger the whole pipe-line of loan-decisions and when all came out positive the loan 
transaction will be finished with positive result 'successfully'. That is all... just some extra 
information with links being provided, e.g. to the transaction record itself and to possible actions 
like printing or reviewing the user status.

<p>Compared with the issuing of an object, returning an object is even simpler : only the object has to 
be identified and the resulting information includes some links :

<p> III.2.5 Renewing a loan-transaction
The renewal of a loan involves checking quite some conditions, e.g. whether reservations have been
created on one of the copies of the title and still another copy for that reservation is available, as 
well as the usual conditions of the user-status.
</p>
<p>The renewal interface simply asks for the ID of the object (the barcode of the book e.g.) and will 
then display the result, which &ndash; if positive &ndash; looks like this :

</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p> III.2.6 Reservation
</p>
<p>Books, or more generally 'objects' can be reserved not only by the end-user from the OPAC (see 
above) but also by the librarians from the EmpWeb interface itself, by definition obeying the same 
rules of course.
</p>
<p>The interface first asks whether a reservation is to be created or to be canceled.
</p>
<p>In case of a reservation creation, the book first needs to be 'identified' by the librarian, with some 
data either on the object ID, the Control Number of the catalog, the title or the author.
</p>
<p>p. 59</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>After the identification the librarian has to click on the control number of the object and the next 
available copy will be put aside, followed by the identification of the user who wants to reserve :
</p>
<p>In case the reservation for this specific user is successful, a message will confirm it. But if for some 
reason, like in the example below, a copy of the title is still available, the librarian will be notified 
as such on this status and an instruction to pick up the available copy will be given :
</p>
<p> III.2.7 Dealing with fines and suspensions
In function of the rules defined in the policy/profile, in certain cases like overdue loans, users can 
be penalized with a fine or even be suspended for a defined span of time.
</p>
<p>This process is either mechanically executed by the system itself (e.g. in case of a late return) or 
manually by the librarian. In this 2nd case the librarian can also add 'observations' to explain the 
reason or conditions.
</p>
<p>p. 60</p>

</div>
<div class="page">

</p>
<p>Suspensions and fines have their own tables in the transa-database which EmpWeb maintains in the 
SQL-environment.
</p>
<p> III.2.8 Reports and statistics
</p>
<p>The last part of the discussion of the use of EmpWeb by the librarian is the reporting/statistics 
module. Differently from the ABCD Central Loans reports/statistics, only pre-defined reports and 
</p>
<p>p. 61</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>statistics can be requested for, but then either for the whole network of libraries covered by 
EmpWeb or for an individual library or branch. In addition reports/statistics can be requested for the
actual status or for a time-span ('historical').
</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the list of current statistics available for the 'current library' 
(AGR) :
</p>
<p>When asking e.g. for the library figures for loans of the library 'AGR' something like the following 
table will be shown with a lot of details (and links) on the loans listed :

delivered, with a list of all active transactions of that type, in this case 'suspensions' :

<p>IV. Annexes
 
</p>
<p> IV.1 EmpWeb Pipelines and Groovy.
</p>
<p> IV.1.1 The concept of Pipelines and Groovy.
All operations realized by EmpWeb correspond to a pipeline. 
We define a  pipeline as a set of ordered processes, sequential or simultaneous, in which the 
output of one process is the input of the following one.
</p>
<p>Groovy is a non-declarative programming language, with a syntax very similar to JAVA and 
with lots of programming facilities. The specifications of the Groovy language can be consulted 
at: http://groovy.codehaus.org/
</p>
<p>The pipelines with which EmpWeb works in this distribution package of EmpWeb can be 
divided in the following groups : 
</p>
<p>Global pipelines. (Configuration Pipelines List)
</p>
<p>These pipelines define values used both in the graphical interface and in other pipelines.
Here we find global values like e.g.  
</p>
<p>- The time-tables of opening hours of each library, 
- the type of material registered for per-hour loans, 
- the maximum time allowed for per hour loans, 
- etc.

<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>These pipelines define the transactions which the main server of EmpWeb manages and of 
which the pipelines will be called by the corresponding processes of the graphical interface.
</p>
<p>Reports pipelines. (Statistics Pipelines List)
</p>
<p>These pipelines are used at the moment of presenting a report. Such report will give an account 
of the requested information where this can be presented in the formats defined by the processes
of the pipeline.
</p>
<p> IV.1.2 Detailed discussion of a pipeline.
</p>
<p>A pipeline is a set of processes, which are executed in a consecutive or simultaneous way, 
ordered and sharing data. Let us consider some of these :
</p>
<p>p. 66</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The ABCD EMPWEB manual
</p>
<p>Since based on the pipeline concept the entry of a process is the output of a previous process, 
exceptions can occur: e.g. This will be the case with the first entry which could be based on data
entered by the user. In the case of EmpWeb, an 'space' of shared objects is used from which the 
processes gather and request their values to shape the transaction as such.
</p>
<p>There are two types of processes in EmpWeb, rules y proper processes. 
1. The rules use the &ldquo;common space for information exchange&rdquo; to check specific values and 
</p>
<p>the rule can return, in function of these values and the negociated rule, &ldquo;true&rdquo; o &ldquo;false&rdquo; as a 
result, indicating with this result if the pipeline should continue or stop.
</p>
<p>2. The proper processes interact with the common space of memory to store values with two 
possible objectives : either to finish the complete transaction or to hand over values to 
subsequent rules in order to test negotiating rules.

</p>
<p>1. Objects accessible during transaction realisation. Common memory space.
It is important to underline that in the common memory space it is possible to get and store 
information which defines a couple (identification, value). This way the identifiers were 
previously defined and it is based upon these couples (identification, value) that the rules and 
processes can interact.
</p>
<p>One of the common memory spaces most used by EmpWeb is the one named 
TransactionContext. In the definition of EmpWeb this space space can gather or store values at 
the moment of running a transaction.
</p>
<p>The concept of TransactionContext corresponds to a hash, which puts a key and developes a 
value from this key. This value can be linear like a String or an Empweb Object.

running a transaction.
</p>
<p>In quite some pipelines, we will find the following processes invoked as initial processes.
It should be noted that these classes have been compiled in JAVA and it is not possible to 
modify then without recompiling the application.  
The comments are taken from the javadoc documentation.

<p>It gets the userCollection XML from the user database and does some validity checks.

<p>The  Process  expects  to  find  the  userId  and  userDb  in  the  TransactionContext  under
TransactionContext.USER_ID  ("userId") and  TransactionContext.USER_DB  ("userDb") keys,
respectively. 
The userCollection DOM object will be stored in the TransactionContext with setUserDOM.
</p>
<p>If the userCollection does not contain at least one user, the Process fails. If it contains more than
one, usually only the first one will be used by the following Processes.
</p>
<p>The Process accepts a boolean parameter checkValidity (default: true). If the parameter is "true"
or  missing  then  the  user  expirationDate  and  state  (active/inactive)  will  be  checked  and  the
Process may fail with an appropriate ProcessResult message.

MODS . 
The database is specified in the TransactionContext's objectDb. 
The object may be specified by copyId or recordId, depending on the mode in which this 
class is used.
The mode is specified with a "mode" parameter in the params of the transaction 
pipeline XML. The value of "mode" can be "copyId" or "recordId".

<p>For "copyId" (the default behavior), it performs a searchObjectsById on the objectDB

<p>The behaviour is as follows: 
 It attempts to get a Profile that matches (userClass, objectCategory)
 If such a Profile does not exist in the currently active Policy then:

<p> IV.1.4 Structure of a process or rule in a pipeline.
</p>
<p>As can be observed, the processes or rules have a first entry-box dedicated for the 
documentation, a second one for the specifications fo the limits and a third one in which the 
paremeters of the process are specified. Let's take the relevant ones one by one.
</p>
<p>Limits published by a process or rule.
</p>
<p>When a process or rule is dependent of a particular profile, let's assume e.g. that we need a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>process which sends an alert to the operator when the actual number of loans is superior to X.
</p>
<p>X is a limit which can have a value set as x1 for the profile  (Students, Books) and a value x2 
for the profile (Directors, Books).
</p>
<p>In this case, it is indicated that X is a limit which will be used within the process or rule with 
the correct value for the profile.
</p>
<p>The syntax for putting values in the limits is as follows :
</p>
<p>&lt;limits&gt;
  &lt;limit name="name"&gt;default value&lt;/limit&gt;
&lt;/limits&gt;
</p>
<p>Let's suppose now that a new limit is created by a particular rule or process. This will imply 
that the value will need to be filled in in all profiles which EmpWeb currently has registered 
for the active policy. In the case that the profile to be used does not have a value filled in for 
the correct profile, the default value will be used. 
</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that before the use of any process or rule which uses limits, The 
basic class GetProfile should have been called, given that if not the default value will always 
be used.
</p>
<p>Parameters for a rule or process.
</p>
<p>The parameters of a particular rule or process can have specific individual behaviours 
specified during the use of the same process or rule in different pipelines.
</p>
<p>The syntax of the parameters is :
</p>
<p>&lt;params&gt;
&lt;param name="attribute"&gt;value&lt;/param&gt;
</p>
<p>&lt;/params&gt;
</p>
<p>An example can be obtained from the basic class UpdateDb, which is used in several 
pipelines, and in which different values could be used for the parameters for each use.
</p>
<p>Example :
</p>
<p>&lt;params&gt;
&lt;param name="transactionKeys"&gt;paymentFine,pendingFine&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;param name="ignoreTransactionNotFound"&gt;true&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;param name="storeUserStatus"&gt;true&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;param name="storeObjectStatus"&gt;false&lt;/param&gt;
</p>
<p>&lt;/params&gt;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>Rule or process types of Groovy scripts.
</p>
<p>Scripted processes or rules are special rules or processes which do not need the file of the 
application to be compiled fully and which allow interaction with the EmpWeb objects like 
for implementing particular negotiation rules.
The structure of a scripted rule or process that can be used consists of :
</p>
<p>The same files are taken into account as with a basic rule or process of EmpWeb, only the 
Groovy script deals with the parameters.
</p>
<p>The structure of this is similar to the one of any parameter of a rule or process.
</p>
<p>&lt;params&gt;
&lt;param name="script"&gt;
</p>
<p>&lt;![CDATA[
</p>
<p>&hellip;. instructios of the script.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>]]&gt;
&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;/params&gt;
</p>
<p>A Groovy script deals with a set of variables which we can call &ldquo;magic variables&rdquo; with which 
one can interact freely :</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>First example of a Groovy script.
The first step for aggregating a Groovy script consists of creating a rule or process for the 
correct pipeline. Continuing the previous example, we will create a new scripted process in 
the Loans pipeline, which will send a message to the operator.
</p>
<p>Clicking on the option Create Process the following window will appear :
</p>
<p>We select the name of a process or rule and indicate that the class which will interprete our 
script will be net.kalio.empWeb.engine.rules.GroovyInterpreter.
</p>
<p>Once filled in this window, the process which we have just created will apper in the pipeline, 
inactive and at the end of the list. 
Important therefore, since the pipeline is an ordered sequence, to put the process within the 
sequence of the pipeline at the right position.  
This will imply, given that we pretend to create a validation rule, that the said rule executes 
before the registration of the transaction. Therefore, using the options 'Up/Down' allowing 
repositioning the process, one has to locate the process at the right position for its execution :</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>Pressing repeatedly on the link Up we drop the new rule to be created  before the execution of
the creation of the Loan entity. So it stays in the position as can be seen under here : 
</p>
<p>Then we press the link Edit and we are ready to create our first Groovy script which validates 
a particular situation.
</p>
<p>Each Groovy script will have a syntax mentioned earlier in its parameters : </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>Warning : If the rule is to be included in the process of basic execution, remember to activate
it after edition, i.e. :
</p>
<p>The rule or process has to be ticked for it to executed. 
So now we can work on our first script. 
</p>
<p>The case to be evaluated, as we envisage, wil lbe : 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The users of type Coordinators will not be allowed to have more than 2 books at the same 
time per reading room or per hour &hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>If we put this in a pseudo-code acting on the Groovy objects, we will have :
</p>
<p>Get the user type;
If the user type is Coordinators then
</p>
<p>For (loans by this user)
If the loan is an object loanable per hour entonces
</p>
<p>Count
End For
If number counted &gt; 1 then
</p>
<p>Send message
Return that the rule failed
</p>
<p>End If
End If
Return that the rule accomplished.
</p>
<p>In this step it will be important to document that in every Groovy script a set of &ldquo;magic 
variables΅ can be used :</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p> Variable tc (TransactionContext)
 Variable params (the parameters of the current rule or process)
 Variable msg (messages which can be produced by the current script)
</p>
<p>Therefore, reviewing the objects which we have available in the EmpWeb Objects universum,
we can analyze how we can get the actua user's type. 
If we look into the list of processes actually existent in the pipeline, we would see that there is
already a process present which is named ExtractUserClass. This one fills in the value for  
TransactionContext. USER_CLASS
</p>
<p>Therefore we could start the Groovy script by checking this value :
tipousuario = tc.get(TransactionContext.USER_CLASS);
If (tipousuario==&rsquo;Students&rsquo;)
{
  
}
return true;
</p>
<p>With this we have implemented the first step, related to the check of the user type. Now we 
will check the current loans which the users has on his name.
For this, we will use the special object type indicated previously, in this case the UserStatus. 
Using this, we can get a list of the objects which correspond to the loans of the actual user.
But how can we get the UserStatus in the current script ?
As in the previous case, when we check the actual pipeline, we will see that there is another 
process, already in the TransactionContext, giving the userStatus needed.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>So, we can access a key from the TransactionContext, which will return the userStatus of the 
current user. 
Using this object userStatus, we can browse the loans of this user.
</p>
<p>uStatus = tc.get(TransactionContext.USER_STATUS);
</p>
<p>Which methods support userStatus? One of them is getLoans(), which will give us the loans 
of the current user :
</p>
<p>loans = uStatus.getLoans();
</p>
<p>We will now try to browse this list returned by the object userStatus and note the loans which 
are relevant to us.
</p>
<p>We use a Groovy loop for this :
for (loan in loansList) {    // Here we will analyze each individual loan}
If we analyze the object type Loan, we will find out that there is no method which gives us the
loaned object type.
This is due to the fact that the Loan object has a reference to the profile (object type, user 
type) in which is was created. </p>

</p>
<p>Thus, this part of the code in Groovy would be as follows :
</p>
<p>Profile prof = loan.getProfile();
If (prof.getObjectCategory=&rsquo;LBH&rsquo;)
{ 
</p>
<p>    //count
}
</p>
<p>Now the final version of our code would read :
&lt;![CDATA[
</p>
<p>usertype = tc.get(TransactionContext.USER_CLASS);
if (usertype =='Coordinators')
{</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>    uStat = tc.get(TransactionContext.USER_STATUS);
    loans = uStat.getLoans();
    counter = 0;
    for (loan in loans)
    {
         Profile prof = loan.getProfile();
         objCateg = prof.getObjectCategory();
         if (objCateg=='LBH')
         {
</p>
<p>       counter++;
         }
</p>
<p>    } 
    
    if (counter&gt;1)
    {
       msg.addText("en_CL_UCV","It's impossible to loan to Coordinators more than 2 
concurrent by hour books");
       msg.addText("es_CL_UCV","No es posible prestar mas de dos libros 
concurrentes por hora a Coordinadores");
       return false;
    }
}
return true;
]]&gt;
</p>
<p>If we dwell on the msg area, it displays a result of the transaction, and its syntax is as follows:
</p>
<p>msg.add (&ldquo;language identifier&rdquo;, &ldquo;message&rdquo;);
</p>
<p>Interestingly, in evaluating the entered script execution stopped; this is due to the fact that 
there is a loan per hour. This is because we have a loan for which the rule when applied does 
not meet the originally specified rule.
We can now conclude that the logics of the pseudo-cod was not correct, and we propose the 
correct version in what follows : 
</p>
<p>Get the user type;
Get the object type which the user wants to take;
</p>
<p>If the user type is Coordinators  AND  the object type is for reading room only then
For ( loans by this user)
</p>
<p>If the loan is of object type per hour hen
Count
</p>
<p>End For
If number counted &gt; 1 then
</p>
<p>Produce message
Return rule failed</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>End If
End If
</p>
<p>Return rule accomplished.
</p>
<p>In the implementation we see that it comes out rather simple to assemble this operation
: 
</p>
<p>&lt;![CDATA[
</p>
<p>UserType = tc.get(TransactionContext.USER_CLASS);
ActualObjectType = tc.get(TransactionContext.OBJECT_CATEGORY);
</p>
<p>if (UserType=='Coordinators' &amp;&amp; ActualObjectType =='LBH' )
{
    uStat = tc.get(TransactionContext.USER_STATUS);
    loans = uStat.getLoans();
</p>
<p>counter = 0;
    for (loan in loans)
    {
         Profile prof = loan.getProfile();
         objCateg = prof.getObjectCategory();
         if (objCateg=='LBH')
         {
</p>
<p>       counter++;
         }
</p>
<p>    } 
    
    if (counter &gt; 1)
    {
       msg.addText("en_CL_UCV","It is impossible to loan to Students more than 2 
concurrent by hour books");
       msg.addText("es_CL_UCV","No es posible prestar mas de dos libros 
concurrentes por hora a estudiantes");
       return false;
    }
}
</p>
<p>return true;
</p>
<p>When we execute this we can observe, for example with the user 01 who is a Coordinator and 
how has the item 10012 on loan, the followin screens : </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>With this we can see clearly the usefulness of associating each message with the identifier fo 
the corresponding language.
</p>
<p>Attention : when sending messages to the MySite these ones would have to be repeated with 
the identifier en and es (or pt, fr, etc) but without the identifier part xx_CL_UCV.</p>
