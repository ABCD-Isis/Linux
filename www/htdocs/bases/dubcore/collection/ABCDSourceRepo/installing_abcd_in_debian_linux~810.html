<p>Installing ABCD in Debian Linux
</p>
<p>1. install Apache2 and PHP5 modules
apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 libxml2-dev
libapache2-mod-proxy-html libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev zlib1g-dev libtidy-dev
libxslt1-dev curl php5-dev php-pear libyaz-dev php5-gd php5-xmlrpc php5-xsl
</p>
<p>2. Download/copy ABCD-installation file, e.g. ABCD12t.tar.gz to your home folder
and unpack it to create a folder /home/ABCD in a terminal with the command :
sudo tar -xvf ABCD12t.tar.gz .
</p>
<p>3. copy the file 'abcd' in the Apache subfolder to the folder
/etc/apache2/sites-available with the command :
sudo cp /home/ABCD/apache/abcd /etc/apache2/sites-available</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>4. create a symbolic link for this file to the sites-enabled folder with the
commands :
cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/abcd .]
</p>
<p>5. change the port for the default website from 80 to e.g. 88 with the command :
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
and in that editor change the line
&lt;VirtualHost *.80&gt;
to
&lt;VirtualHost *.88&gt;
and press Ctrl-x, then press Enter to confirm saving the changes.
</p>
<p>6. restart Apache2 with the command :
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>7. test your ABCD configuration now : open your browser (e,g, Firefox) and enter
the URL 'localhost'
If everything was o.k., you will get the ABCD login screen.
</p>
<p>Important notice : download the 64-bits version of the executables of CISIS to put
in the cgi-bin folder !</p>

<p>Installation of YAZ :
Installation for UBUNTU / DEBIAN
tested for v.12.04 Server LTS but supposedly o.k. for all versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>Installing the Yaz PHP plugin and dependencies.
</p>
<p>Debian/Ubuntu
apt-get install yaz libyaz4-dev php5-dev php-pear php5-xsl make
</p>
<p>pecl install yaz
</p>
<p>create : /etc/php5/conf.d/yaz.ini con el contenido extension=yaz.so
apache2ctl restart
You'll also need File_MARC:
pear install Structures_LinkedList
pear install File_MARC
</p>
<p>You may need to specify versions if pear fails with 'beta channel' messages:
pear install Structures_LinkedList-0.2.0
pear install File_MARC-0.4.2
</p>
<p>Fine-tuning
Depending on your local conditions, e.g. using 32-bits or 64-bits Linux, there are
some more small things to do :
- if using 32-bits : rename /opt/ABCD/www/cgi-bin to cgi-bin64
and rename /opt/ABCD/www/cgi-bin32 to cgi-bin
(this will activate the 32-bits version of CISIS and set the 64-bits version aside).</p>

<p>EMPWEB
EmpWeb (ABCD Advanced Loans), if used (since there is already a built-in
'standard' Loans module in ABCD Central), needs quite some extra configuration
actions :
- download and install the latest Java JDK, either OpenJDK or Sun-Java-JDK, e.g. with
the command
apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
and find out where it was installed exactly, e.g. with the command
find / -iname=javac
which will list all folders where the executable 'javac' is found. Note the one you
have installed (as there might be others which were already installed before).
Put the path to the java-folder into empweb.sh in the folder /opt/ABCD/empweb
where the JAVA_HOME and JAVA variables are defined, e.g. :
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-sun-1.7.0.16/bin"
JAVA="$JAVA_HOME/java"
but often (in the case of OpenJDK) the java-executable itself is not in the same
folder as javac, in that case create a symbolic link to java in the folder where you
found javac, or put the full correct path in the 2nd variable 'JAVA', e.g.
JAVA="/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-sun-17.0.16/jre/bin/java".
The first parameter $JAVA_HOME points to the FOLDER where you found javac.
The second parameter $JAVA points to the executable file 'java' itself.
</p>
<p>- if using Empweb ABCD Advanced Loans in Linux 64-bits version : EmpWeb
supposes the 'mx' executable to be in /cgi-bin/ as defined by Apache ScriptAlias.
There is a problem when this executable itself is 64-bits due to incompatibilities
with Java. The solution is to use the 32-bits version of CISIS in
/opt/ABCD/www/cgi-bin, but since then iAH will have problems running in 64-bits,
you have to copy the 64-bits version of wxis.exe into the cgi-bin folder and rename
it (in order to not overwrite wxis.exe 32-bits version !) as 'wxis64.exe'.
Finally change the URL in index.php of the folder /opt/ABCD/www/htdocs/iah, to
point to the 64-bits version of wxis.exe in the cgi-bin folder as follows :
header("Location: /cgi-bin/wxis64.exe/iah/scripts/?IsisScript=iah.xis&amp;lang=" .
$lang . "&amp;base=" . $base);
- change coda.jspf to avoid the &lt;io Request(...)</p>

<p>TO DO in deb package :
change EMPWEB_HOME and JETTY_HOME in
empweb/common/etc/init.d/empweb :OK
add reservation and cancelreservation in /engine/WEB-INF-conf/enginconf.xml :OK
change backup dir in /opt/ABCD/htdocs/central/bridge/config.inc.php :OK
change %EMPWEB_HOME to $EMPWEB_HOME in empweb.sh :OK
</p>
<p>gui\WEB_INF\web.xml : line 121 URL+path to user_photo ! also : line 77 of user.tag
in gui\WEB-INF\tags\display ??
change dr_path for users and biblo
in empweb.sh : set CISIS_HOME and MX variables (CISIS-Wrapper)</p>
