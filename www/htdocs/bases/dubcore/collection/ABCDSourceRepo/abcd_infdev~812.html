<p>ABCD : a new FOSS library automation 
solution based on ISIS12. 
 
Egbert de Smet, University of Antwerp (Belgium) 
 
 
Abstract : The new ABCD software for free and open library automation with ISIS is 
presented with its technological and practical characteristics. As a web-based integrated 
solution it combines most (if not all) functions of other systems such as KOHA with the 
flexibility of the (Win)ISIS software to create and handle databases of any structure. The 
main technical characteristics as well as some managerial issues are briefly presented. 
The planning on the further work is discussed along with some challenges related to the 
specific nature of the ISIS users community.

<p>Introduction 
 
The CDS/ISIS software, initially developed and supported by UNESCO since decades, 
has developed into a &lsquo;family&rsquo; with many sister-softwares using the same database 
technology for text-retrieval, and evolved from main-frame to PC-DOS, PC-Windows 
now into web-based technology on various platforms. The main actor nowadays is 
BIREME (PAHO/WHO, Brazil) where the software is used in very advanced ways to run 
online databases (bibliographical and full-text) of millions of mostly medical documents. 
 
For many people CDS/ISIS always has been a &lsquo;library software&rsquo;, which in essence is 
wrong since the software only provided a general-purpose text-retrieval database 
solution. It was and still is mainly used in libraries, and library automation indeed can be 
done nicely but with major development efforts to this needing added, as shown by e.g. 
the WEBLIS software with web-based integrated library functions. 
Also BIREME has been developing specific library functions based on ISIS, such as a 
&lsquo;Serials Control System&rsquo; (SeCS), a web-based OPAC (iAH) and advanced loan 
management (EMP). Based on modern web-technology possibilities, such as AJAX, 
PHP-scripting etc&hellip;, the idea has grown to produce a full-blown library automation 
system combining the available ISIS-technology into one all-encompassing software to 
finally provide the ISIS users with a real library system indeed. 
With the (financial) support of the Flemish Interuniversity Council (Development Co-
operation section) (VLIR/UOS), BIREME (OPS/WHO, Brazil) is now presenting the 
results of a major development effort on the &lsquo;Automatisaci&oacute;n de Bibliot&eacute;cas y Centros de 
Documentaci&oacute;n&rsquo; or ABCD software -  the credit for the name goes to Abel Packer, 
BIREME director and long-time ISIS aficionado.

International Conference on ISIS, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), 14-16 September 2008.

home page http://www.unesco.org/isis </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>ABCD also marks the shift &ndash; both by UNESCO and BIREME &ndash; towards full &lsquo;Free and 
Open Source Software (FOSS)&rsquo; and builds on the free availability of both the sources of 
the codes and a &lsquo;developers community&rsquo; (web-based) environment. The GNU Public 
License (GPL) is chosen as the most appropriate model. 
 
The support of the Belgian VLIR/UOS is based on the need to offer such free software to 
its university library partners, many of them already using ISIS but in need of more 
advanced tools with respect for established standards or protocols such as MARC, 
METS, OAI/HP, Z39.50. Also full UNICODE-support is required (to allow usage of 
different scripts, e.g. Amharic language in Ethiopia); this technology allowing 
simultaneous use of quite different scripts is important in view of the international and 
multicultural mandate held by UNESCO. 
 
</p>
<p>ABCD technology overview 
 
</p>
<p>Basic technological features 
 
ABCD uses the following technologies : 
 
</p>
<p>A. Multi platform : it will run on Windows, UNIX/Linux and OS/X. 
B. Multi-lingual : it will run independent from the language and many language 
</p>
<p>versions can and will be produced. 
C. ISIS databases : all data are stored in ISIS-databases, using current but 
</p>
<p>extended capacity (1 Mb record limit, 4 Gb database limit, 60-character inverted 
file keys). However as soon as available, the new &lsquo;Network Based Platform&rsquo; of 
ISIS will substitute for this older technology and take away all sexisting limitations 
and add full UNICODE functionality. 
</p>
<p>D. ISIS-Script : for flexible retrieval and formatting of ISIS-records, the ISIS-Script 
language is used, of course &ndash; as this is the nucleus of ISIS &ndash; combined with the 
power of the Formatting Language to &lsquo;mould&rsquo; data from the records. 
</p>
<p>E. PHP : this very widely used FOSS software for web-pages scripting (currently in 
its 5.2 version), adds lots of existing functions, controls and tools to ISIS. For 
advanced interactivity in a web-environment AJAX-technology is used, 
emphasizing local &lsquo;client-based&rsquo; processing to minimize of limited internet 
bandwidth usage, which is a typical problem of the mainly &lsquo;developing world&rsquo; 
characteristics of the ISIS-users community. 
</p>
<p>F. JavaScript : again very widely used, this technology adds possibilities to have 
information locally processed within web-pages and to make these pages more 
flexible/interactive. 
</p>
<p>G. Client-Server : the meanwhile familiar web-browser (in principle any of the known 
ones : MS IE, Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari&hellip;) acts as the client whereas the 
server has a web-server (e.g. Apache) forwarding all page creation requests to 
an ISIS web-server executable (currently WXIS, to be replaced by the NBP 
version soon). ABCD will both provide classic CGI-based interaction (where all 
pages are requested through the http-protocol with web-server based security) 
and direct calling of the ISIS-server executable (faster in a well-protected 
&lsquo;localhost&rsquo; environment). 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>The installation of the software therefore requires some carefully taken steps :  
A. installation of a web-server (the free Apache seems to be most the most likely 
</p>
<p>candidate) with proper access rights given through &lsquo;aliases&rsquo; (or virtual directories) 
to allow writing to the databases; 
</p>
<p>B. installation of PHP with some advanced add-ons such as XSLT support and YAZ 
(for the Z39.50 client built into ABCD); 
</p>
<p>C. installation/copying of the demo databases, the many scripts with help pages 
etc.; 
</p>
<p>D. editing of the correct file system paths to system parts and variables, e.g. the 
responsible institute&rsquo;s name, in a simple text file &lsquo;CONFIG.PHP&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>Of course, after its current &lsquo;alpha&rsquo; and soon upcoming &lsquo;beta&rsquo; test versions the software 
will be presented with a full installation package, avoiding most of these far-from-obvious 
technical challenges. However being a sophisticated web-based software, simplicity 
cannot be fully reached, but examples of e.g. &lsquo;WAMP&rsquo; or &lsquo;EasyPHP&rsquo; are already showing 
the way in this respect. 
</p>
<p>Functionality and modules 
 
ABCD is an integrated library automation software, which means that it offers all main 
functions in a library system. Some major bibliographic standards are offered by default : 
MARC, CEPAL, AGRIS. But, and this is special we think (and is reflected by the addition 
&lsquo;CD&rsquo; for &lsquo;documentation centers&rsquo; in the name), the system will also offer a very flexible 
environment for web-based management of all sorts of documents and textual 
databases, including full-text without pre-defined structures. 
 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;AB&rsquo; : modules for automation of libraries 
The classic library automation (automatisaci&oacute;n de bibiliot&eacute;cas) modules are presented 
as follows : 
</p>
<p>A. Users management and access control : a database is maintained with user-
names and passwords and access control to an unlimited number of databases 
in 4 authorization levels (system administrator, database administrator, database 
operator, loans operator). 
</p>
<p> 
B. Cataloging : one or more catalog databases in any of the defined bibliographic 
</p>
<p>formats (MARC, CEPAL and AGRIS having been pre-defined) can be browsed, 
searched and edited. Records can be created, modified, copied, deleted, 
imported and exported (from ISO2709, TXT and XML input). A Z39.50 client can 
download MARC-records from existing online catalogs with, if defined, on-the-fly 
conversion (also applicable to exported records). The display formats (selectable 
from a menu) are based on the ISIS Formatting Language (meaning any number 
of formats can be used), editing forms and both field- and record-validation all 
are externally definable with access to thesauri, pick-lists from authority 
databases etc&hellip; with all values produced by the powerful Formatting Language.  
Two highlights in the cataloging module are : </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>a. the &lsquo;toolbar&rsquo; : giving the interface more of a &lsquo;local software&rsquo; looks-and-feel 
</p>
<p> 
b. the A-&gt;Z list browser for quick location of records. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>Needless to say that all ISIS-fields and subfields (as intensively used in MARC) 
can be edited individually without a need to know the internal coding, repeatable 
occurrences of fields can be easily added and all elements have help-pages 
documenting their meaning. In the MARC structure separate interaction with the 
so-called &lsquo;fixed-field&rsquo; values is provided. 
 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>A. Site with OPAC : a &lsquo;home page&rsquo; integrating the end-user search (basic, with 
advanced as an option) with a CMS-editable environment page (for links with 
information resources, partners, news items etc&hellip; is based on the iAH software 
which BIREME uses for its main information products. This search-interface 
allows searching (and merging results) from several databases or individual 
databases, and ranked and cluster-based presentation of search results (based </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>on Lucene indexing, another novelty within the new ISIS developments). 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>A. Serials Control System : a separate module allows management of a database of 
serial publications along with individual editing of all issues. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>A. Loans management and Statistics : the loans implementation is fully rules-based, 
meaning that any number of rules (regulations) can be defined on any number of 
object types for any number of users for reservations, loaning out and returning 
library objects. Book items can be either retrieved from a separate database of 
items or, alternatively (for simpler systems) from a repeated field in the catalog. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>  
 
The Statistics module works in 2 steps :  
a. Definition of data to be table in a numerical table (from any field in any 
</p>
<p>database) 
b. Graphical presentation of the tables based on existing advanced PHP 
</p>
<p>graphing controls. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>This means that not only the circulation system can be monitored, but analysis 
can be performed on any ISIS database in fact. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>A. Acquisition module : as this is probably the least important feature certainly in the 
Developing World (where acquisitions mostly are confined to gifts and 
exchange), this module will come last and only in a rather limited implementation, 
combining &lsquo;pre-cataloging&rsquo; functions with the management of a providers&rsquo; 
database. 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;CD&rsquo; for Documentation Centres 
 
ABCD wants to be more than just a library automation software. (CDS/)ISIS always has 
been much more, i.e. a general-purpose tool for management of textual databases. This 
capacity has been, and still is, widely used throughout the world, both in the South and 
the North, by thousands of information and documentation centers where no pre-defined 
structures or standards were or are available. 
ISIS-users used to use CDS/ISIS for DOS or WinISIS to define their own structures (with 
Field Definition, Field Selection, Print Formats and Worksheets) for any kind of data. 
Due to the built-in feature of ISIS to easily handle repeatable fields with variable number 
of occurrences and length, no relational capabilities are required for the designer &ndash; 
although by linking databases a semi-relational structure can also be used with the 
advantage that relations are only used &lsquo;as-needed&rsquo; (run-time). 
All this is now available also in the ABCD web-environment, with some additional 
capabilities based on the rich web-environment : 
</p>
<p>A. full text documents : text-content from documents can be inserted in the rich-text 
editor provided by PHP (FCKeditor is used); current record limitation is 1 Mb but 
this limit will be dropped with the adoption of NBP in the ISIS Software Family 
soon; 
</p>
<p>B. links : html-links (&lsquo;&lt;A HREF=&rdquo;..&rdquo;&gt;) can easily be embedded to call upon the 
&lsquo;hypertext&rsquo; navigation features of the web 
</p>
<p>C. multimedia : the WWW is multimedia, so ABCD gives easy access to such 
multimedia documents. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p> 
ABCD therefore has been tested with databases on factual information (such as 
contacts databases, laws/regulation sets) and multimedia applications as well (image 
databases, museum catalogs &ndash; where ISIS is increasingly used - etc.). 
The software provides full interfaces to create and manipulate database structures : 
</p>
<p>A. field definitions, editing workheets, print formats, field indexing tables 
B. validations on both field- and record-level 
C. copy structures from existing ones 
D. importing/exporting from existing databases or TXT (CSV), ISO2709 and XML-
</p>
<p>data 
</p>
<p>E. lock/unlock, initializing and deleting of databases.  
 
</p>
<p>As with the library automation part on cataloging, all fields can be entered using any 
HTML-Form element (textarea, select list, radio-button) and based on any authority 
database. To this end the &lsquo;classic&rsquo; ISIS Field Definition Table was largely extended with 
new columns, e.g. name of authority database, validation formats,  help-pages etc. 
</p>
<p> 
 
The ABCD resource people think this feature of flexible, multi-purpose but relatively easy 
database creation differentiates ABCD from most other library automation solutions, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>preparing the libraries for much more information provision roles than just their own 
catalog.  
As all this is offered in a multi-lingual tool, with full UNICODE-support upcoming, it is 
argued that such initiative fully supports the ambitious aims of the &lsquo;IFLA Multicultural 
Library Manifesto&rsquo;3 (see : 
http://www.ifla.org/VII/s32/pub/MulticulturalLibraryManifesto.pdf) , which a.o. should  
&ldquo;develop culturally diverse and multilingual collections and services, including digital and 
multimedia resources; allocate resources for the preservation of cultural expression and 
heritage, paying particular attention to oral, indigenous and intangible cultural heritage;&rdquo;.  
  
</p>
<p>                                                
3  This Manifesto was approved by the Governing Board of IFLA in August 2006 
and endorsed in April 2008 by the Intergovernmental Council for UNESCO&rsquo;s Information 
for All Programme with the recommendation that it be submitted to the 35th session of 
the General Conference of UNESCO for consideration. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p/>
<p>ABCD further development planning 
 
</p>
<p>Timing 
At the Rio Conference (September 2008) a first test version of the ABCD software was 
distributed, mainly to allow people to get a sense and feeling of the software and to 
consider participation in the major translation efforts (of not only the software, but also 
documentation and training materials). 
A real, full-fledged beta-release of the software is envisaged to be ready by the end of 
2008. This version will then also contain the full Loans module (with statistics) which was 
only demonstrated at the Conference, and a rather basic Acquisition module. The project 
&lsquo;Development Of and Capacity Building in ISIS Based Library Automation Systems&rsquo; 
(DOCBIBLAS) of VLIR/UOS needs a first release by mid March 2009 for its first pilot 
workshop on the software (for its own partner university libraries). Also this version for 
VLIR/UOS needs to become available in three languages : English, Spanish and French. 
BIREME of course will have added a Portuguese version as well, but more language 
versions are most welcome and for this the world-wide ISIS users community will have 
to be engaged, which requires good co-ordination and management efforts (see infra). 
 
</p>
<p>Migration to the new Network Based Platform of ISIS 
Another major planning element is the migration of ABCD to NBP, the new underlying 
ISIS technology being developed currently by BIREME. This will provide full UNICODE 
support, database capacities only limited by hardware (not software) and technological 
co-operation schemes based on the  &lsquo;ISIS-cell&rsquo; philosophy, in which all different ISIS-
implementations present themselves as independent but communicating units 
encompassing both the data, a command-line tool to manipulate the data and a gateway 
for allowing other protocols (e.g. http, cgi) to interact with the cell. 
This migration in principle will be &lsquo;seamless&rsquo;, i.e. transparent to end-users but also 
system managers, as only the most basic layer of the system will be substituted (e.g. 
with another cgi-server in ABCD). Since NBP also, like J-ISIS, relies on Lucene 
indexing, full-text searching and ranked/clustered presentation of search results will 
become normal practice with ABCD in the course of 2009. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>ABCD management issues 
</p>
<p>More and different co-ordination efforts needed 
 
With the shift towards FOSS a new model of technical support and management of the 
software is needed. While ISIS always has been &lsquo;free&rsquo; (no payment), the software 
development was rather well controlled : mostly within UNESCO, later within BIREME 
under quite strict &lsquo;closed&rsquo; supervision. The basic software structures were published, 
allowing others to program their own solutions based on the same standard &ndash; which has 
been done indeed all over the world and a project &lsquo;OpenISIS&rsquo; had run on SourceForge in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>the years 2003-2006 &ndash; and the software itself had a very open architecture also 
promoting the production of diverse applications 4. 
 
</p>
<p>Building on the United Nations mandate 
The limited resources of UNESCO to deal with these developments now require new 
management structures to be set up. At the 3rd International Conference on ISIS (Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil, 14-16 September 2008) it was decided to establish therefore an &lsquo;ISIS 
International Steering Committee&rsquo; whose main goal is to promote, through lobbying, co-
operation in between UNESCO and BIREME (based on a Memory of Understanding) 
and organize the users&rsquo; input into the development and documentation processes. One 
central idea is that UNESCO should not only welcome and fully adopt BIREME&rsquo;s 
technological achievements but also help in making these available to all partner 
countries (not only the Latin-American ones directly served by BIREME).  
Two or three other UN-related organizations c/should also join this effort : FAO (Rome, 
Italy) has been using ISIS technology for more than 15 years in its world-wide &lsquo;AGRIS&rsquo; 
and &lsquo;ASFISIS&rsquo; systems and libraries, and also UNEP (Nairobi, Kenya) uses ISIS for its 
libraries and bibliographic projects.  
More joint efforts could reinforce the ISIS developments, now with even more focus on 
training and capacity building on the new ISIS-products presented in Rio. Training and 
capacity building are at the core of both the UN&rsquo;s development philosophy and the ISIS 
project to promote sustainability and self-sufficiency in the participation by the South in 
the global Information/Knowledge Society, esp. with the &lsquo;Information for All Programme&rsquo; 
(IFAP) 5. 
 
</p>
<p>Working together to secure compatibility and preserve the ISIS 
identity 
Co-ordination will also be needed to secure compatibility in between the new BIREME-
based ISIS software products, for which the FOSS support is using a developers&rsquo; 
environment at BIREME itself (reddes.bireme.br) and the new UNESCO-based J-ISIS (a 
client-server JAVA implementation of the software, using Sun&rsquo;s java.org platform for 
open source development). Again co-ordination here requires both technical co-
ordination (J-ISIS uses Berkeley DB as a storage engine, while BIREME&rsquo;s NBP is still 
identifying the best choice but taking Berkely DB as an excellent candidate), but also 
working together at the more practical levels, e.g. using different developers&rsquo; 
communities tools adds complexity into this big challenge. 
The main challenge however will be the preservation of the identity of ISIS as a software 
family, with its own medium-level application development tool (mainly the ISIS 
Formatting Language) allowing local system managers to fully manipulate the software 
to a locally owned tool &ndash; &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; in this case again requiring capacity building for 
self-sufficient control of the software. Through avoiding the &ndash; for documentary 
applications &ndash; unnecessary complexity of relational systems, while still using excellent 
document handling technology, ISIS provides such possibility more than most other 
solutions, at least in principle.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>ABCD aims at proving this point too, but will have to cope with the specific nature of 
most of ISIS&rsquo; user communities : highly dedicated and motivated but with quite poor 
resources (in many cases even to connect with other users !) and relatively low levels of 
capacity and skills. 
 
</p>
<p>Final observation 
This finally brings us to the core questions at stake, whose answers will get &ndash; hopefully &ndash; 
a catalyst factor from the ABCD project : 
</p>
<p>A. Is library automation, at an advanced level incorporating currently available state-
of-the-art software technology (such as WWW &ndash; even WEB2.0 -, full-text 
documents and ranked retrieval), omitting unnecessary complexity since such 
basic complexity is unavoidable in a complex environment, viable in developing 
environments, even if given for free ? 
</p>
<p>B. Is international co-operation, lead by some major UN-bodies (UNESCO, WHO, 
FAO&hellip;), capable of indeed promoting this ? 
</p>
<p>C. Is Open Source collaboration, not only in the software coding but also, perhaps 
more importantly, in the production of help pages, documentation and training 
materials, a suitable model, if properly set up, to reach such high goals ? 
</p>
<p> 
This article, which only aimed at initially presenting ABCD, will not give these answers of 
course. But we hope, by putting the questions clearly on the table, that efforts can be 
more focused towards reaching these goals, and that answers therefore not only will 
come well delineated but also more positive. </p>
