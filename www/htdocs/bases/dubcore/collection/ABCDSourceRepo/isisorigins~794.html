<p>Abstract
While Free and Open Source Software is still gaining momentum also in library automation, it is still 
not a trivial event to launch a full-blown ILS given today's high demands on such library systems. In 
this article we explain the ISIS-software origins of the newly launched ABCD-software for which there 
is a more-than-average interest in many parts of the Southern libraries and information communities. 
Many &ndash; especially younger &ndash; librarians in the West have never heard about ISIS and its relevance and 
technological concepts, so we will try to shed some light on this in order for librarians to better judge 
on the meaning of the ABCD software for international libarianship and &ndash; why not ? - perhaps even 
their own purposes.
</p>
<p>Overview :
The origins of ISIS
ISIS as a software family
The specific technological concepts of ISIS
The specific social reality of ISIS
ABCD as a new ISIS family member
</p>
<p>The origins of ISIS
For those who know about ISIS (or with its full name : CDS/ISIS), there is often a partly correct but 
also partly incorrect association with 'old' (and outdated?) software. Indeed the origins of ISIS stem 
back to the 1970's &ndash; almost pre-history in Computer Science &ndash; when in the International Labour 
Organisation, one of the many United Nations member organizations, two earlier developed 
documentation systems were combined into one : the 'Central Documentation System' (CDS) merged 
with the 'Integrated Set of Information Services' software and became CDS/ISIS. This software, 
running on the then obvious platforms (VMS and large computer systems), ran as a series of 
specialized functions and commands to store or retrieve records in a database (with its own 
idiosyncratic database format) and apply B-Tree based indexing on them, including the then far from 
obvious 'word-indexing' (nowadays known and very popular 'full-text'). CDS/ISIS was one of the first 
softwares implementing the then new principles of 'ISAM' (Index-Sequential Access Method) on which 
later many database-technologies became grounded. The main developer, Gianpaulo Del Bigio, not 
only was a specialist programmer but also close to library science concepts like UNISIST (another old 
system on which later on many modern bibliographic systems were based). 
</p>
<p>UNESCO got highly interested in CDS/ISIS as a tool which perhaps could be offered to its less-
developed country partners for advanced and professional bibliographic control. Mr. Del Bigio moved 
to UNESCO and migrated the software to the then (1985) new 'Micro-computer' platform of DOS to 
present 'Micro CDS/ISIS' as one of the first database softwares which not only could run on two floppy 
disks (A and B) but still offered powerful storage and indexing capacity.
</p>
<p>This Micro CDS/ISIS for DOS became a huge success in its world-wide distribution and use, mostly in 
Developing Countries. UNESCO received and responded to tens-of-thousands of request for the 
software and sent it out on floppy disks (later also CD's) to all hidden corners of the South. By this time </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>the software (as from version 2.3) was fully menu-driven and got (in its version 3) full networking 
capability with multi-user database-, record- and index-protecion. The software also got &ndash; again from 
the genious of Del Bigio &ndash; a built-in programming language (CDS/ISIS Pascal) which allowed 
developing not only local functions for data-manipulation but even the creation of independent 
interfaces.  In addition the menu-structure was not only language-independent (allowing creating of 
versions in any language, including the Chinese version which I saw still widely used there back in 
1995), but also changing the menu-structures and sequences. I described this very 'open' architecture of 
the software elsewhere to illustrate how CDS/ISIS in fact was a fore-runner in the concept of 'Open' 
software (see [reference]).
</p>
<p>This enormous success later on became also a handicap : way too long the software kept running in its 
typical (DOS-based non-graphical) 'black window' where still the keyboard had to be used to invoke 
functions without the use of a 'mouse', while especially in the Western libraries GUI (graphical user 
interface) techniques &ndash; Windows/Icons/Mouse/Pull-down menu's &ndash; became ubiquitous. Slower access 
to more powerful PC's and lower replacement cycli in the South caused this to last much longer in the 
Developing World and created the somehow 'old-fashioned' (and hence out-dated) image of the 
software.
</p>
<p>Still as from 1995 UNESCO and Del Bigio worked on a full migration of the software into Windows as 
'CDS/ISIS for Windows', presented in 1997 (at the first World Congress on CDS/ISIS in Bogota, 
Colombia), which again became very popular world-wide as 'WinISIS'. The power of the software, 
mostly based on a powerful 'formatting language' (instructions to exactly define how data from the 
fields in the records are extracted and presented to several software functions like display, sorting, 
indexing, exporting..) remained while now lots of graphical features became available : hyperlinks, 
multi-media, run-time relational links to other databases etc.
</p>
<p>Again 10 years later &ndash; 2005 &ndash; the software got several 'WWW-capable' server-versions (ISIS3W from 
Poland, OpenISIS in Germany, and most importantly 'wwwisis' from Brazil), proving not only that the 
software kept closely in touch with new technological developments but also got development centers 
and expertise in many countries out of the UNESCO-context. E.g. the Polish technology was hired by 
another UN organization : FAO for use in its AGRIS-system for agricultural information (later also 
ASFISIS for fishery and aquatic sciences) and the Brazilian institute 'BIREME' is the Latin-American 
information center of the World Health Organization, nowadays running huge databases (16 million 
records) with abstracts and full-text online based on ISIS-technology developed in-house and 
meanwhile having become the main development center of ISIS.
</p>
<p>UNESCO opted in 2005 fully for 'Free and Open Source Software' and shifted its focus to a wider 
support for this type of softwares, lowering its direct input in software development of CDS/ISIS and 
handing this over to a 'FOSS ISIS community' (see www.iccisis.org). Still in 2009 a complete overhaul 
based on a client-server Java architecture was presented as 'J-ISIS', now based on Berkely DB 
unlimited capacity and Lucene (full-text) indexing.
</p>
<p>ISIS as a software family
The brief historical sketch above shows how (CDS/)ISIS not only became widely used in libraries in 
many, mostly southern, parts of the world but also how others took up the technology and started 
programming software based on the same technological concepts. These concepts, which form the 
common 'family characteristics' of the ISIS-software family, can be summarized as follows :
</p>
<p>&bull; 'scheme-less' records (i.e. no fixed structure is implied onto the records, but each record carries </p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="http://www.iccisis.org/"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>its own 'identity card' as an ISO-2709 header describing structure and contents) with variable 
length and structure (i.e. fields of any length can be present 0 up to x times in any record).
</p>
<p>&bull; All data are stored in fields and subfields which are simply identified with their numerical tag 
followed by the string of the field-data; this basic 'tag-value' approach nowadays is gaining 
interested in computer science again thanks to a new 'NO-SQL' movement (see [reference]).
</p>
<p>&bull; All data coming from the fields go through a 'filter' mechanism steered by a detailed and 
powerful 'formatting language'; this grammar allows librarians, without a need to become real 
programmers, to define the use of their data in very much detailed and advanced ways 
(including relational use of data from other databases) and in our view is the basis for ISIS' 
rather unique capability to allow sophisticated local developments and management with still 
often very limited availability of computer science skills and knowledge.
</p>
<p>&bull; Based on the ISIS Formatting Language, values in the databases can be indexed in many ways 
into an 'Inverted File' where all extracted strings are accessible in an almost volume-
independent fast (B-tree) structure for immediate retrieval of the records (with exact 
information on field-occurrence and word-positions) linked to that extracted value.
</p>
<p>&bull; The Formatting Language also allow importing and exporting the data according to very 
specific instructions, taking away mostly the need for conversion expertise when migration is 
needed.
</p>
<p>A family-picture of the many members, all reflecting these technology concepts, looks as follows (with 
of course some necessary simplifications and omissions) : 
</p>
<p>As one can see, last year 2009 was a crucial year with 3 quite different new developments having been 
presented, one of them being ABCD on which we will focus after we also briefly discussed some non-
technical characteristics of the software. The ISIS 'Network Based Platform' mentioned is BIREME's 
effort to introduce ISIS into the most recent software technologies of unlimited storage capabilities, 
full-text indexing with vector-space and relevance ranking concepts, based on Python but also 
providing a strong abstraction layer (through the 'ISIS-cell' concept) allowing links with any ISIS-</p>

<p/>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p>The specific social reality of ISIS
Regardless of its rather unique technological concepts, ISIS as a software family also represents a 
specific social reality. Softwares nowadays are much more than just technical artifacts, often they 
include phenomena like strong 'believers' and 'non-believers' &ndash; it is indeed remarkable to note how even 
political interventions  and 'raising temperatures' guide decisions on software selection, also when it 
comes to library automation projects.
</p>
<p>Due to its background in the UN, as illustrated above, ISIS has both its defenders (believers) and 
opposition. It never used 'SQL' or relational database concepts, which are still very dominant in modern 
computer science &ndash; most computer science students in the developing countries will only have had to 
read a textbook on SQL when it comes to databases &ndash; and therefore also never got a strong interest in 
computer science environments.
</p>
<p>The interest however came from library and information experts who converted them to computer 
scientists without losing sight on the very specific demands of bibliographic and documentary 
information systems. Standards like ISBD, MARC and ISO2709, but also UNISIST (with the concept 
of bibliographic levels) and thesaurus technology remained at the core of the database-technology 
itself. When the WWW became ubiquitous, ISIS again did not need input from computer scientists who 
thought they had re-invented the information world : simply using the long-standing Formatting 
Language ISIS records could be presented as HTML-pages. Same story for XML...
</p>
<p>In addition to this aspect 'computer science by and for information workers' ISIS &ndash; again from its 
international UN-based bias &ndash; carries a second characteristic : the 'developing world' typical users-
environments. Like in car-production Volkswagen was said to be 'Mr. Nobody's Porsche' (but we know 
how this story ended recently...) ISIS was sometimes seen as &ldquo;poor man's library system'. Forgetting 
that ISIS in fact is not even a library system, only a general-purpose tool allowing poor librarians to 
develop their own sustainable databases to semi-automate their libraries, ISIS compared unfavorably in 
scientific publications against e.g. KOHA &ndash; a comparison which now needs to be fully re-done with the 
arrival of ABCD ! - and became seen as a poor substitute for the 'real thing' when means or skills were 
non-existing or insufficient to allow use of professional softwares. Even from a simply technological 
point of view we think this is wrong judgement, but the social reality and image of ISIS as a tool for 
poor librarians in underdeveloped environments will be very difficult to eradicate. 
</p>
<p>Of course UNESCO emphasized and focused on promotion of the software, according to its own 
specific mandate, in developing countries for very good reasons. Not only ISIS offers its professional 
capabilities without a need for time-and-again the very latest software skills, it also runs on moderate or 
even low-level hardware &ndash; I recall many situations where African libraries were still using old 
Windows 3-based or even non-graphical-capability PC's running ISIS.
</p>
<p>Also users of ISIS in the Western world typically were to be found in non-profit environments &ndash; the 
free distribution of ISIS by UNESCO was even explicitly based on the non-profit requirement &ndash; again 
strengthening the image of ISIS in this sense of being linked with economically less-powerful users. In 
Flanders (Belgium) e.g. typical ISIS-users were the the network of NGO on Development Co-operation 
but also in Cultural Work and &ndash; long ago because nowadays all incorporated into larger units with more 
economical power to purchase commercial solutions &ndash; smaller medical (and school) libraries.
</p>
<p>The use of ISIS however in state-of-the-art systems like the ScIELO information system of BIREME &ndash; 
offering huge amounts of documents on medical and social information in Open Access full-text </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>electronic journals &ndash; proves that this option to focus on developing countries is not a technological 
weakness but rather an arbitrarily chosen ambition : to provide tools for joining the Information Society 
to everybody. This is indeed UNESCO's basic mandate when it comes to information, and that is also a 
reason why in our view UNESCO cannot ever fully withdraw from the ISIS development scene.
</p>
<p>ABCD as a new ISIS family member
</p>
<p>This article will not fully present ABCD as an integrated library system itself &ndash; we can refer to some 
other publications elaborating on this (see [reference]). 
</p>
<p>The basic statement however here is that &ndash; for the first time in the history of ISIS &ndash; a full-blown 
dedicated and integrated library system is provided based on ISIS-technology. Other attempts to 
offering such integrated library solutions based on ISIS, e.g. Open MarcoPolo and Weblis, were very 
meritorious efforts, but never (or not yet ?) reached to the level of ABCD in its attempt to offer state-of-
the-art technology without breaking with the typical ISIS-community needs as sketched above. 
</p>
<p>The ABCD acronym however illustrates an ever further-reaching ambition : not only to automate 
libraries ('Automatisaci&oacute;n de Bibliot&eacute;cas' , 'Automatisation de Biblioth&egrave;ques' or AB in many languages) 
but also to provide a tool for automating Documentation Centers ('Centros de Documentaci&oacute;n' etc. or 
simply 'CD'). 
</p>
<p>What does this mean ? We think it is even the most unique and special feature of the software, so this 
needs some brief comment here. 
</p>
<p>By being fully independent from the bibliographic structures used &ndash; but already offering some widely 
used standards like MARC (21 and UNI) or CEPAL (a widely used bibliographic format in Latin 
America) &ndash; ABCD allows any structure to be created by the software itself and subsequently being 
managed (cataloging, OPAC and circulation). This is indeed based on the fact that ABCD offers a full 
ISIS-interface in a web-environment (using PHP-programming) including all typical ISIS-definitions 
such as 'Field Definition Table', 'Field Selection Table' and of course the crucial Formatting Language.
</p>
<p>This means that not only libraries, but equally documentation centers, archives or musea can use the 
software while sticking to their own dedicated information structures, or even better : organizations can 
use ABCD to integrate such related but still different functions into one web-based system. By being 
fully web-based, ABCD of course can also offer multi-media capability (important e.g. for musea) but 
also offer full electronic document handling, paving the way for digital libraries.
</p>
<p>This capability, maybe not unique but still very special and powerful, in its own right again offers 
something extra to the typical ISIS-users, taking away the need to develop skills (and/or maintenance 
resources) for running different systems for different purposes with a common 'information-service' 
functionality. They often cannot even afford to develop such different support mechanisms...
</p>
<p>Still ABCD is presented as a software incorporating all major and important current standards in 
information services. When the Flemish Interuniversity Council's Development Co-operation section 
(VLIR/UOS, see http: //www.vliruos.be) decide to support the ABCD-development throught its project 
'DOCBIBLAS' (Development Of and Capacity Building in ISIS-Based Library Automation Systems) in 
2007-2010, such professional criteria allowing usage by university libraries, were explicitly required : 
MARC, Z39.50, MODS/METS etc. In addition ABCD comes with its own OAI-HP server allowing 
harvesting of records by other non-ISIS based webservices. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>In more than one way ABCD represents the culmination and integration of many mostly BIREME-
developed ISIS-tools, e.g. the meta-search (i.e. covering any number of internal and external databases 
which can be included into the search) capability, the CMS&mdash;based library 'portal', the advanced Serials 
Management (for local and union catalogs of serial, also electronic, publications) and finally the 
Advanced Loans module, which allows linking to non-ISIS user-databases and multiple loans-policy 
implementations. The ABCD software therefore is best presented as a 'suite' of co-operating but also 
independent softwares : 
</p>
<p>In this scheme the 'Central' module contains the 'heart' of the software with the main crucial library-
automation functions, allowing smaller libraries with less technology skills to fully automate without 
leaving the familiar (as most ABCD-users are expected to be the current ISIS-users) ISIS environment 
and building upon that often significant experience : locally developed database-structures and print 
formats, or indeed the available skills in using the ISIS-formatting language, can still be re-used while 
migration to more professional or widely-used standards is still easily within reach. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion
With the new-born ISIS-family member 'ABCD' an old long-standing tradition of ISIS-developments is 
continued and fully brought into the modern database-driven web-applications. Combining the old but 
proven-technology concepts of the historical ISIS with both web-technology and integrated library and 
documentation centers automation functions, ABCD brings a hopefully welcome solution and </p>
<p/>

<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>continuation for the many existing ISIS-users all over the world, but maybe even will attract renewed 
interest from young, modern librarians who are open to alternatives for the commercial ILS-providers 
who are by (economical) necessity making their globalized users market more dependent rather than 
more self-supporting and self-empowered.</p>
